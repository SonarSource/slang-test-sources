# React & Apollo Quickstart

In this quickstart tutorial, you'll learn how to build a fullstack app with React, GraphQL and Node.js. You will use [`graphql-yoga`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-yoga/) as your web server. The server is connected to a Prisma database service using [`prisma-binding`](https://github.com/graphcool/prisma-binding). To learn more about GraphQL server development and the required architecture, read the corresponding [Introduction](!alias-quohj3yahv) chapters.

> The code for this project can be found as a _GraphQL boilerplate_ project on [GitHub](https://github.com/graphql-boilerplates/react-fullstack-graphql/tree/master/basic).

## Step 1: Install required command line tools

The first thing you need to do is install the command line tools you'll need for this tutorial:

- `graphql-cli` is used initially to bootstrap the file structure for your fullstack app with `graphql create`
- `prisma` is used continuously to manage your Prisma database service

<Instruction>

```sh
npm install -g graphql-cli
```

</Instruction>

> Note that you don't have to globally install the Prisma CLI as it's listed as a _development dependency_ in the boilerplate project you'll use. However, we still recommend that you install it. If you don't install it globally, you can invoke all `prisma` commands by prefixing them with `yarn`, e.g. `yarn prisma deploy` or `yarn prisma playground`.

## Step 2: Bootstrap your React fullstack app

<Instruction>

Now you can use `graphql create` to bootstrap your project. With the following command, you name your project `my-app` and choose to use the `react-fullstack-basic` boilerplate:

```
graphql create my-app --boilerplate react-fullstack-basic
cd my-app
```

Feel free to get familiar with the code. The app contains the following React [`components`](https://github.com/graphql-boilerplates/react-fullstack-graphql/tree/master/basic/server/src/components):

- `Post`: Renders a single post item
- `ListPage`: Renders a list of post items
- `CreatePage`: Allows to create a new post item
- `DetailPage`: Renders the details of a post item and allows to update and delete it

Here is an overview of the generated files in the `server` directory and their roles in your server setup:

- `/server`
  - [`.graphqlconfig.yml`](https://github.com/graphql-boilerplates/react-fullstack-graphql/tree/master/basic/server/.graphqlconfig.yml) GraphQL configuration file containing the endpoints and schema configuration. Used by the [`graphql-cli`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-cli) and the [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-playground). See [`graphql-config`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-config) for more information.
- `/server/database`
  - [`database/prisma.yml`](https://github.com/graphql-boilerplates/react-fullstack-graphql/tree/master/basic/server/database/prisma.yml): The root configuration file for your database service ([documentation](https://www.prismagraphql.com/docs/reference/prisma.yml/overview-and-example-foatho8aip)).
  - [`database/datamodel.graphql`](https://github.com/graphql-boilerplates/react-fullstack-graphql/tree/master/basic/server/database/datamodel.graphql) contains the data model that you define for the project (written in [SDL](https://blog.graph.cool/graphql-sdl-schema-definition-language-6755bcb9ce51)). We'll discuss this next.
  - [`database/seed.graphql`](https://github.com/graphql-boilerplates/react-fullstack-graphql/tree/master/basic/server/database/seed.graphql): Contains mutations to seed the database with some initial data.
- `/server/src`
  - [`src/schema.graphql`](https://github.com/graphql-boilerplates/react-fullstack-graphql/tree/master/basic/server/src/schema.graphql) defines your **application schema**. It contains the GraphQL API that you want to expose to your client applications.
  - [`src/generated/prisma.graphql`](https://github.com/graphql-boilerplates/react-fullstack-graphql/tree/master/basic/server/src/generated/prisma.graphql) defines the **Prisma schema**. It contains the definition of the CRUD API for the types in your data model and is generated based on your `datamodel.graphql`. **You should never edit this file manually**, but introduce changes only by altering `datamodel.graphql` and run `prisma deploy`.
  - [`src/index.js`](https://github.com/graphql-boilerplates/react-fullstack-graphql/tree/master/basic/server/src/index.js) is the entry point of your server, pulling everything together and starting the `GraphQLServer` from [`graphql-yoga`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-yoga).

Most important for you at this point are `database/datamodel.graphql` and `src/schema.graphql`.

`database/datamodel.graphql` is used to define your data model. This data model is the foundation for the API that's defined in `src/schema.graphql` and exposed to your React application.

Here is what the data model looks like:

```graphql(path="server/database/datamodel.graphql")
type Post {
  id: ID! @unique
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
  description: String!
  imageUrl: String!
}
```

Based on this data model Prisma generates the **database schema**, a [GraphQL schema](https://blog.graph.cool/graphql-server-basics-the-schema-ac5e2950214e) that defines a CRUD API for the types in your data model. In your case, this is only the `Post` type. The database schema is stored in `database/schema.generated.graphql` and will be updated every time you [`deploy`](!alias-kee1iedaov) changes to your data model.

## Step 3: Deploy the Prisma database service

Before you can start the server, you first need to make sure your Prisma database service is available. You can do so by deploying it with the `prisma deploy` command.

In this case, you'll deploy the Prisma database service to the **free development cluster** of Prisma Cloud. Note that this cluster is not intended for production use, but rather for development and demo purposes.

> Another option would be to deploy it locally with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). You can follow the [Node.js Quickstart tutorial](!alias-phe8vai1oo) to learn how that works.

<Instruction>

Deploy the database service from the `server` directory of the project:

```bash(path="")
cd server
prisma deploy
```

</Instruction>

<Instruction>

When prompted which cluster you want to deploy to, choose the `development` cluster from the **Prisma Cloud** section.

</Instruction>

> **Note**: If you haven't authenticated with the Prisma CLI before, this command is going to open up a browser window and ask you to login. Your authentication token will be stored in the global [`~/.prisma`](!alias-zoug8seen4).

You Prisma database service is now deployed and accessible under [`http://prisma/my-app/dev`](http://prisma/my-app/dev).

As you might recognize, the HTTP endpoint for the database service is composed of the following components:

- The **cluster's domain** (specified as the `host` property in `~/.prisma/config.yml`): `http://localhost:4466/my-app/dev`
- The **name** of the Prisma service specified in `prisma.yml`: `my-app`
- The **stage** to which the service is deployed, by default this is calleds: `dev`

Note that the endpoint is referenced in `server/src/index.js`. There, it is used to instantiate `Prisma` in order to create a binding between the application schema and the database schema:

```js(path="src/index.js"&nocopy)
const server = new GraphQLServer({
  typeDefs: './src/schema.graphql',
  resolvers,
  context: req => ({
    ...req,
    db: new Prisma({
      typeDefs: 'src/generated/prisma.graphql',
      endpoint: '`http://localhost:4466/my-app/dev`',
      secret: 'mysecret123',
    }),
  }),
})
```

You're now set to start the server! ðŸš€

## Step 4: Start the server

<Instruction>

Execute the `start` script that's define in `server/package.json`:

```bash(path="server")
yarn start
```

</Instruction>

The server is now running on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

## Step 5: Open a GraphQL playground to send queries and mutations

Now that the server is running, you can use a [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-playground) to interact with it.

<Instruction>

Open a GraphQL Playground by executing the following command:

```bash(path="server")
prisma playground
```

</Instruction>

Note that the Playground let's you interact with two GraphQL APIs side-by-side:

- `app`: The web server's GraphQL API defined in the **application schema** (from `./server/src/schema.graphql`)
- `database`: The CRUD GraphQL API of the Prisma database service defined in the **database schema** (from `./server/src/generated/prisma.graphql`)

![](https://imgur.com/z7MWZA8.png)

> Note that each Playground comes with auto-generated documentation which displays all GraphQL operations (i.e. queries, mutations as well as subscriptions) you can send to its API. The documentation is located on the rightmost edge of the Playground.

Once the Playground opened, you can send queries and mutations.

<Instruction>

Paste the following mutation into the left pane of the `app` Playground and hit the _Play_-button (or use the keyboard shortcut `CMD+Enter`):

```grahpql
mutation {
  createDraft(
    title: "A rare look into the Prisma office"
    text: "https://media2.giphy.com/media/xGWD6oKGmkp6E/200_s.gif"
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```

</Instruction>
<Instruction>

To publish the draft, aste the following mutation into the left pane of the `app` Playground and hit the _Play_-button (or use the keyboard shortcut `CMD+Enter`):

```grahpql
mutation{
  publish(id:"cjg3fvin8003707135mmlg99t"){
    isPublished
  }
}
```

</Instruction>

<Instruction>

To retrieve the `Post` node that was just created and published, you can send the following query in the `app` Playground:

```graphql
{
  feed {
    title
    text
  }
}
```

</Instruction>

## Step 6: Launch the React application

The last thing to do is actually launching the application ðŸš€

<Instruction>

Install dependencies and run the app:

```sh(path="server")
cd ..
yarn install
yarn start # open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
```

</Instruction>

# Database Access (SQL)

Follow this guide to connect directly to the MySQL database powering your local Prisma cluster.

If you used `prisma local start` to start your local Prisma cluster, you will have two containers running:

`prisma` is running the main Prisma service

`prisma-db` is running the MySQL server that stores your data

This guide explains how to connect to your local MySQL server in order to query and update data directly.

> In the following, we assume that you have a local Prisma service running.

#### 1. Get the name of the Docker container that runs the MySQL database

list your running Prisma Docker containers:

```sh
docker ps --filter name=prisma
```

Verify that there is a container with the name `prisma-db` image `mysql:5.7`.

#### 2. Open MySQL client

To open the MySQL client in your terminal, run the following command. Note that prisma-db is the container name from the list above:

```sh
docker exec -it prisma-db mysql -u root --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3306 --password=graphcool
```

#### 3. Send SQL queries to the database

Once the MySQL client is open, you can ask for the currently available databases:

```mysql
show databases;
```

This will print the following output:

```
+---------------------------+
| Database                  |
+---------------------------+
| information_schema        |
| prisma                    |
| logs                      |
| mysql                     |
| performance_schema        |
| sys                       |
| <service-id>              |
+---------------------------+
```

From the available databases, the following three are relevant for you:

* `<service-id>`: The name of this database is a combination of the name and stage of your service. It looks like this: `service@stage`. It contains meta information about your service used to generate the GraphQL schema.
* `prisma`: This database contains meta-information about the Prisma service definition.

You can now select one of these databases with the `use` command, for example if your `<service-id>` is `my-service@dev`, then run:

```mysql
use my-service@dev;
```

You can list tables like this:

```sh
show tables;
```

```
+----------------------+
| Tables_in_my-app@dev |
+----------------------+
| Post                 |
| _RelayId             |
+----------------------+
```

Now you can start writing queries:

```sh
SELECT * FROM Post;
```

```
+---------------------------+---------------------+---------------------+-------------+----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| id                        | createdAt           | updatedAt           | isPublished | title                | text                                            |
+---------------------------+---------------------+---------------------+-------------+----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+

```

You can quit MySQL like this:

```sh
exit;
```

# Setup Prisma

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to get started with Prisma and deploy a Prisma service to a _Demo server_.

Demo servers provide a hosted environment (running in Prisma Cloud) which you can use for learning, prototyping and development. They are free to use but should not be used for production use cases as they are rate limited and have an upper bound in storage capacity.

**Pro tip**: ðŸ’¡ If you're only keen on getting started but don't care so much about the explanations of what's going on, you can simply jump from instruction to instruction.

</InfoBox>

## Step 1: Install the Prisma CLI

Prisma services are managed with the [Prisma CLI](!alias-je3ahghip5). You can install it using `npm` (or `yarn`).

<Instruction>

Open your terminal and run the following command to install the Prisma CLI:

```sh
npm install -g prisma
# or
# yarn global add prisma
```

</Instruction>

## Step 2: Bootstrap a Prisma service

<Instruction>

Open a terminal and navigate to a folder of your choice. Then bootstrap your Prisma service with the following command:

```sh
prisma init hello-world
```

</Instruction>

After running the command, the CLI will ask you if you want to use an existing [Prisma server](!alias-eu2ood0she) or set up a new one.

<Instruction>

To get started quickly in this tutorial, you'll use the Prisma **Demo server** running on Prisma Cloud.

</Instruction>

If you haven't registered with Prisma Cloud before, the CLI will now open a browser window asking you to sign up.

<Instruction>

Follow the instructions in the browser to register with Prisma Cloud.

</Instruction>

After you've sucessfully logged in, you need to select the _region_ for your Demo server.

<Instruction>

Select either **demo-eu1** or **demo-us1** (the CLI will display the latencies for each server so you know which one will perform better for your specific location).

</Instruction>

Next, the CLI will prompt you to configure the _name_ and _stage_ for your Prisma API.

<Instruction>

Just confirm the suggested values by hitting **Enter** two times.

</Instruction>

This will create a new directory called `hello-world` as well as the two files which provide a minimal setup for your service:

- [`prisma.yml`](!alias-foatho8aip): The root configuration file for your service. It contains information about your service, like the name (which is used to generate the service's HTTP endpoint), a secret to secure the access to the endpoint and where it should be deployed.
- `datamodel.graphql` (can also be called differently, e.g. `types.graphql`): This file contains the definition of your [data model](!alias-eiroozae8u), written in [GraphQL SDL](https://blog.graph.cool/graphql-sdl-schema-definition-language-6755bcb9ce51).

Let's take a look at the contents of the generated files:

**`prisma.yml`**

```yml
endpoint: https://eu1.prisma.sh/alice-doe-fd2dcf/hello-world/dev
datamodel: datamodel.graphql
```

Note that the endpoint will look slightly different for you as `alice-doe-fd2dcf` is the ID of your Prisma Cloud _workspace_ which hosts the service.

Here's an overview of the properties in the generated `prisma.yml`:

- `endpoint`: Defines HTTP endpoint of the Prisma API ([learn more](!alias-ufeshusai8#endpoint-optional)).
- `datamodel`: The path to the file which contains your data model ([learn more](!alias-ufeshusai8#datamodel-required)).

**`datamodel.graphql`**

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @unique
  name: String!
}
```

The data model contains type definitions for the entities in your application domain. In this case, you're starting out with a very simple `User` type with an `id` and a `name`.

The `@unique` directive here expresses that no two `User` records in the database can have the same `id`, Prisma will ensure this requirement is met at all times.

## Step 3: Deploy your Prisma service to a Demo server

The `prisma init` command only bootstrapped the _files_ for your Prisma service, but it didn't actually _deploy_ it - so you can't use your CRUD GraphQL API for the `User` type yet.

<Instruction>

To achieve that, navigate into the `hello-world` directory and run the `prisma deploy` command:

```bash
cd hello-world
prisma deploy
```

</Instruction>

Your Prisma API is now deployed and ready to receive your queries, mutations and subscriptions ðŸŽ‰

## Step 4: Explore Prisma's GraphQL API in a GraphQL Playground

So your Prisma service is deployed - but how do you know how to interact with it? What does its API actually look like?

In general, the generated API allows you to perform CRUD operations on the types in your data model. It also exposes GraphQL subscriptions which allow clients to _subscribe_ to certain _events_ and receive updates in realtime.

It is important to understand that the data model is the foundation for your API. Every time you make changes to your data model (and run `prisma deploy` afterwards), the schema of Prisma's GraphQL API gets updated accordingly.

Because your data model contains the `User` type, the Prisma API now allows for its clients to create, read, update and delete records, also called _nodes_, of that type. In particular, the following GraphQL operations are now generated based on the `User` type:

- `user`: Query to retrieve a single `User` node by its `id` (or another `@unique` field).
- `users`: Query to retrieve a list of `User` nodes.
- `createUser`: Mutation to create a new `User` node.
- `updateUser`: Mutation to update an existing `User` node.
- `deleteUser`: Mutation to delete an existing `User` node.

> **Note**: This list of generated operations is not complete. The Prisma API exposes a couple of more operations that, for example, allow you to batch update/delete many nodes. However, all operations either create, read, update or delete nodes of the types defined in the data model.

To actually use these operations, you need a way to [send requests to your service's API](!alias-ohm2ouceuj). Since that API is exposed via HTTP, you could use tools like [`curl`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL) or [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to interact with it. However, GraphQL actually has much nicer tooling for that purpose: [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-playground), an interactive GraphQL IDE.

<Instruction>

To open a GraphQL Playground you can use the Prisma CLI again. Run the following command inside the `hello-world` directory:

```sh
prisma playground
```

</Instruction>

This will open a Playground looking as follows:

> **Note**: The Playground can be installed on your machine as a [standalone desktop application](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-playground/releases). If you don't have the Playground installed, the command automatically opens a Playground in your default browser.

One really cool property of GraphQL APIs is that they're effectively _self-documenting_. The [GraphQL schema](https://blog.graph.cool/graphql-server-basics-the-schema-ac5e2950214e) defines all the operations of an API, including input arguments and return types. This allows for tooling like the GraphQL Playground to auto-generate API documentation.

<Instruction>

To see the documentation for your Prisma API, click the green **SCHEMA**-button on the right edge of the Playground window.

</Instruction>

This brings up the Playground's documentation pane. The left-most column is a list of all the operations the API accepts. You can then drill down to learn the details about the input arguments or return types that are involved with each operation.

## Step 5: Send queries and mutations

All right! With everything you learned so far, you're ready to fire off some queries and mutations against your API. Let's start with the `users` query to retrieve all the `User` nodes currently stored in the database.

<Instruction>

Enter the following query into the left Playground pane and click the **Play**-button (or use the hotkey **CMD+Enter**):

```graphql
query {
  users {
    name
  }
}
```

</Instruction>

At this point, the server only returns an empty list. This is no surprise as we haven't actually created any `User` nodes so far. So, let's change that and use the `createUser` mutation to store a first `User` node in the database.

<Instruction>

Open a new tab in the Playground, enter the following mutation into the left Playground pane and send it:

```graphql
mutation {
  createUser(data: {
    name: "Sarah"
  }) {
    id
  }
}
```

</Instruction>

This time, the response from the server actually contains some data (note that the `id` will of course vary as the server generates a globally unique ID for every new node upon creation):

```json
{
  "data": {
    "createUser": {
      "id": "cjc69nckk31jx01505vgwmgch"
    }
  }
}
```

<Instruction>

You can now go back to the previous tab with the `users` query and send that one again.

</Instruction>

This time, the `User` node that was just created is returned in the server response:

![](https://imgur.com/LfXtmbc.png)

Note that the API also offers powerful filtering, ordering and pagination capabilities. Here are examples for queries that provide the corresponding input arguments to the `users` query.

**Retrieve all `User` nodes where the `name` contains the string `"ra"`**

```graphql
query {
  users(where: {
    name_contains: "ra"
  }) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

**Retrieve all `User` nodes sorted descending by their names**

```graphql
query {
  users(orderBy: name_DESC) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

**Retrieve a chunk of `User` nodes (position 20-29 in the list)**

```graphql
query {
  users(skip: 20, first: 10) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

## Where to go from here?

You can now go and **[build a GraphQL server](!alias-ohdaiyoo6c)** based on this API.

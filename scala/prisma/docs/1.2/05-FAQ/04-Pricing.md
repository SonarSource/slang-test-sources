# Pricing

More info on pricing structure will follow soon. For now, the following points are important:

- Prisma is entirely open-source and be hosted with any cloud provider
- There is a free public cluster that can be used to deploy Prisma services without cost or even requiring authentication
- There will be hosting options in the Prisma Cloud in the future

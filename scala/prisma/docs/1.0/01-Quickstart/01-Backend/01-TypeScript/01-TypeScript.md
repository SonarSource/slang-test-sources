# TypeScript Prisma Quickstart

In this quickstart tutorial, you'll learn how to build a GraphQL server with TypeScript. You will use  [`graphql-yoga`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-yoga/) as your web server which is connected to a "GraphQL database" using [`prisma-binding`](https://github.com/graphcool/prisma-binding).

> The code for this project can be found as a _GraphQL boilerplate_ project on [GitHub](https://github.com/graphql-boilerplates/typescript-graphql-server/tree/master/basic).

## Step 1: Install required command line tools

Throughout the course of this tutorial, you'll use the Prisma CLI to create and manage your Prisma database service. So, the first step is to install the CLI.

<Instruction>

Open your terminal and globally install the Prisma CLI:

```sh
npm install -g prisma
```

</Instruction>

You also need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your machine.

<Instruction>

If you don't have Docker installed on your machine yet, go and download it now from the official website:

- [Mac OS](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac)
- [Windows](https://www.docker.com/docker-windows)

</Instruction>

After it's downloaded, you can install it right away. Note that this also gives you access to the `docker` CLI.

## Step 2: Bootstrap your GraphQL server

Now you can use `prisma init` to bootstrap your GraphQL server. Note that this command will trigger an interactive prompt that allows to select a template your project should be based on.

<Instruction>

Because you're passing `my-app` as an argument to `prisma init`, the Prisma CLI will create a new directory called `my-app` where it will place all the files for your project:

```sh
prisma init my-app
```

</Instruction>

<Instruction>

When prompted how you want to set up your Prisma service, choose `GraphQL server/fullstack boilerplate (recommended)`.

</Instruction>

<Instruction>

The CLI now prompts you to select a [GraphQL boilerplate](https://github.com/graphql-boilerplates) as foundation for your project. Select the [`typescript-basic`](https://github.com/graphql-boilerplates/typescript-graphql-server/tree/master/basic) boilerplate here.

</Instruction>

<Instruction>

Finally, when prompted which cluster you want to deploy to, choose the `local` cluster.

</Instruction>

After `prisma init` has finished, your Prisma database service is deployed and will be accessible under [`http://localhost:4466/my-app/dev`](http://localhost:4466/my-app/dev).

As you might recognize, the HTTP endpoint for the database service is composed of the following components:

- The **cluster's domain** (specified as the `host` property in `~/.prisma/config.yml`): `http://localhost:4466/my-app/dev`
- The **name** of the Prisma `service` specified in `prisma.yml`: `my-app`
- The **stage** to which the service is deployed, by default this is calleds: `dev`

Note that the endpoint is referenced in `src/index.ts`. There, it is used to instantiate `Prisma` in order to create a binding between the application schema and the Prisma schema:

```ts(path="src/index.ts"&nocopy)
const server = new GraphQLServer({
  typeDefs: './src/schema.graphql',                 // points to the application schema
  resolvers,
  context: req => ({
    ...req,
    db: new Prisma({
      endpoint: 'http://localhost:4466/my-app/dev', // the endpoint of the Prisma DB service
      secret: 'mysecret123',                        // specified in `database/prisma.yml`
      debug: true,                                  // log all GraphQL queries & mutations
    }),
  }),
})
```

Here's the file structure of the project:

![](https://imgur.com/95faUsa.png)

Let's investigate the generated files and understand their roles:

- `/` (_root directory_)
  - [`.graphqlconfig.yml`](https://github.com/graphql-boilerplates/typescript-graphql-server/tree/master/basic/.graphqlconfig.yml) GraphQL configuration file containing the endpoints and schema configuration. Used by the [`graphql-cli`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-cli) and the [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-playground). See [`graphql-config`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-config) for more information.
- `/database`
  - [`database/prisma.yml`](https://github.com/graphql-boilerplates/typescript-graphql-server/tree/master/basic/database/prisma.yml): The root configuration file for your database service ([documentation](https://www.prismagraphql.com/docs/reference/prisma.yml/overview-and-example-foatho8aip)).
  - [`database/datamodel.graphql`](https://github.com/graphql-boilerplates/typescript-graphql-server/tree/master/basic/database/datamodel.graphql) contains the data model that you define for the project (written in [SDL](https://blog.graph.cool/graphql-sdl-schema-definition-language-6755bcb9ce51)). We'll discuss this next.
  - [`database/seed.graphql`](https://github.com/graphql-boilerplates/typescript-graphql-server/tree/master/basic/database/seed.graphql): Contains mutations to seed the database with some initial data.
- `/src`
  - [`src/schema.graphql`](https://github.com/graphql-boilerplates/typescript-graphql-server/tree/master/basic/src/schema.graphql) defines your **application schema**. It contains the GraphQL API that you want to expose to your client applications.
  - [`src/generated/prisma.graphql`](https://github.com/graphql-boilerplates/typescript-graphql-server/tree/master/basic/src/generated/prisma.graphql) defines the **Prisma schema**. It contains the definition of the CRUD API for the types in your data model and is generated based on your `datamodel.graphql`. **You should never edit this file manually**, but introduce changes only by altering `datamodel.graphql` and run `prisma deploy`.
  - [`src/index.ts`](https://github.com/graphql-boilerplates/typescript-graphql-server/tree/master/basic/src/index.ts) is the entry point of your server, pulling everything together and starting the `GraphQLServer` from [`graphql-yoga`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-yoga).

Most important for you at this point are `database/datamodel.graphql` and `src/schema.graphql`. `database/datamodel.graphql` is used to define your data model. This data model is the foundation for the API that's defined in `src/schema.graphql` and exposed to your client applications.

Here is what the data model looks like:

```graphql(path="database/datamodel.graphql")
type Post {
  id: ID! @unique
  isPublished: Boolean!
  title: String!
  text: String!
}
```

Based on this data model Prisma generates the **Prisma schema**, a [GraphQL schema](https://blog.graph.cool/graphql-server-basics-the-schema-ac5e2950214e) that defines a CRUD API for the types in your data model. This schema is stored in `src/generated/prisma.graphql` and will be updated by the CLI every time you [`deploy`](!alias-kee1iedaov) changes to your data model.

You're now set to start the server! ðŸš€

## Step 4: Start the server

<Instruction>

Invoke the `dev` script that's defined in `package.json`. It will start the server and open a [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-playground) for you.

```bash(path="")
cd my-app
yarn dev
```

</Instruction>

Note that the Playground let's you interact with two GraphQL APIs side-by-side:

- `app`: The web server's GraphQL API defined in the **application schema** (from `./src/schema.graphql`)
- `database`: The CRUD GraphQL API of the Prisma database service defined in the **Prisma schema** (from `./src/generated/prisma.graphql`)

![](https://imgur.com/z7MWZA8.png)

> Note that each Playground comes with auto-generated documentation which displays all GraphQL operations (i.e. queries, mutations as well as subscriptions) you can send to its API. The documentation is located on the rightmost edge of the Playground.

Once the Playground opened, you can send queries and mutations.

### Sending queries and mutations against the application schema

The GraphQL API defined by your application schema (`src/schema.graphql`) can be accessed using the `app` Playground.

<Instruction>

Paste the following mutation into the left pane of the `app` Playground and hit the _Play_-button (or use the keyboard shortcut `CMD+Enter`):

```grahpql
mutation {
  createDraft(
    title: "GraphQL is awesome!",
    text: "It really is."
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```

</Instruction>

If you now send the `feed` query, the server will still return an empty list. That's because `feed` only returns `Post` nodes where `isPublished` is set to `true` (which is not the case for `Post` nodes that were created using the `createDraft` mutation). You can publish a `Post` by calling the `publish` mutation for it.

<Instruction>

Copy the `id` of the `Post` node that was returned by the `createDraft` mutation and use it to replace the `__POST_ID__` placeholder in the following mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  publish(id: "__POST_ID__") {
    id
    isPublished
  }
}
```

</Instruction>

<Instruction>

Now you can finally send the `feed` query and the published `Post` will be returned:

```graphql
query {
  feed {
    id
    title
    text
  }
}
```

</Instruction>

### Sending queries and mutations against the Prisma API

The GraphQL CRUD API defined by the Prisma schema (`src/generated/prisma.graphql`) can be accessed using the `database` Playground.

As you're now running directly against the database API, you're not limited to the operations from the application schema any more. Instead, you can take advantage of full CRUD capabilities to directly create a _published_ `Post` node.

<Instruction>

Paste the following mutation into the left pane of the `database` Playground and hit the _Play_-button (or use the keyboard shortcut `CMD+Enter`):
`
```graphql
mutation {
  createPost(
    data: {
      title: "What I love most about GraphQL",
      text: "That it is declarative.",
      isPublished: true
    }
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```

</Instruction>

The `Post` node that was created from this mutation will already be returned by the `feed` query from the application schema since it has the `isPublished` field set to `true`.

In the `database` Playground, you can also send mutations to _update_ and _delete_ existing posts. In order to do so, you must know their `id`s.

<Instruction>

Send the following query in the `database` Playground:

```graphql
{
  posts {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

</Instruction>

<Instruction>

From the returned `Post` nodes, copy the `id` of the one that you just created (where the `title` was `What I love most about GraphQL`) and use it to replace the `__POST_ID__` placeholder in the following mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  updatePost(
    where: { id: "__POST_ID__" },
    data: { text: "The awesome community." }
  ) {
    id
    title
    text
  }
}
```

</Instruction>

With this mutation, you're updating the `text` from `That it is declarative.` to `The awesome community.`.

<Instruction>

Finally, to delete a `Post` node, you can send the following mutation (where again `__POST_ID__` needs to be replaced with the actual `id` of a `Post` node):

```graphql
mutation {
  deletePost(
    where: { id: "__POST_ID__" }
  ) {
    id
    title
    text
  }
}
```

</Instruction>

## Use Prisma GraphQL API

Every Prisma service exposes a GraphQL API with CRUD and realtime operations for the types defined in the service's datamodel. This API is called the **Prisma API**.

The GraphQL schema defining the types and operations of the Prisma API is referred to as the **Prisma GraphQL schema**. It is automatically generated by Prisma.

The Prisma API is based on the following [datamodel](knul):

```graphql
type Post {
  id: ID! @unique
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
  isPublished: Boolean! @default(value: "false")
  title: String!
  text: String!
  author: User!
}

type User {
  id: ID! @unique
  email: String! @unique
  password: String!
  name: String!
  posts: [Post!]!
}
```

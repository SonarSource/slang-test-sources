## Overview

### How are subscriptions in the Prisma API generated?

The GraphQL API of a Prisma service is specified in the Prisma GraphQL schema. The Prisma GraphQL schema is auto-generated based on the service's datamodel:

The `Subscription` type of the Prisma GraphQL schema defines all the subscriptions the Prisma API accepts.

As an example, consider the following datamodel:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @unique
  name: String!
}
```

This is the `Subscription` type Prisma will generate:

```graphql
type Subscription {
  user(where: UserSubscriptionWhereInput): UserSubscriptionPayload
}
```

For every type in your datamodel, one subscription is generated. Taking above the above `User` type as an example, this subscription is:

- `user`: Fires whenever a `User` node is **created**, **updated** or **deleted**. (Except for [batch mutations](qwe2#batch-mutations)).

To inspect all the available operations of your Prisma API in detail, you can read the Prisma GraphQL schema of your Prisma service. It can be downloaded with the [GraphQL CLI](https://github.com/graphql-cli/graphql-cli): 

```bash
graphql get-schema --endpoint __YOUR_PRISMA_ENDPOINT__ --output prisma.graphql --no-all
```

Another way to learn about the concrete capabilities of your Prisma API is by exploring the auto-generated API documentation inside a GraphQL Playground. You can do so by clicking the green **SCHEMA**-button at the right edge of the Playground:

### Datamodel for examples on this page

All example subscriptions on this page are based on a Prisma service configured with this datamodel:

```graphql
type Post {
  id: ID! @unique
  title: String!
  published: Boolean! @default(value: "false")
  author: User
}

type User {
  id: ID! @unique
  name: String!
  posts: [Post!]!
}
```

## Understanding Prisma’s subscription API

Prisma lets you *subscribe* to three different kinds of events (per type in your datamodel). Taking the `Post` type from above datamodel as an example, these events are:

- a new `Post` nodes is *created*
- an existing `Post` nodes is *updated*
- an existing `Post` nodes is *deleted*

<Warning>

Subscriptions are nor firing for [batch mutations](qwe2#batch-mutations).

</Warning>


The corresponding definition of the `Subscription` type looks as follows (this definition can be found in the Prisma GraphQL schema):

```graphql
type Subscription {
  post(where: PostSubscriptionWhereInput): PostSubscriptionPayload
}
```

Here is what a sdle subscription operation looks like:

```graphql
subscription {
  post {
    node {
      id
      title
    }
  }
}
```

If not further constrained through the `where` argument, the `post` subscription will fire for all of the events mentioned above. Which fields of the `PostSubscriptionPayload` are included in messages from the server depends on the kind of event.

### Filtering for specific events

The `where` argument allows clients to specify exactly what events they’re interested in. Maybe a client always only wants to receive updates when...

- ... a `Post` gets *deleted* 
- ... a `Post` where the `title` contains a specific keyword is *created*

These kinds of constraints can be expressed using the `where` argument. The type of `where` is `PostSubscriptionWhereInput`:

```graphql
input PostSubscriptionWhereInput {
  # Filter for a specific mutation:
  # CREATED, UPDATED, DELETED
  mutation_in: [MutationType!]

  # Filter for a specific field being updated
  updatedFields_contains: String
  updatedFields_contains_every: [String!]
  updatedFields_contains_some: [String!]

  # Filter for concrete values of the Post being mutated
  node: PostWhereInput

  # Combine several filter conditions
  AND: [PostSubscriptionWhereInput!]
  OR: [PostSubscriptionWhereInput!]
}
```

The two examples mentioned above could be expressed with the following subscriptions in the Prisma API:

```graphql
# Only fire for _deleted_ posts
subscription {
  post(where: {
    mutation_in: [DELETED]
  }) {
    # ... we'll talk about the selection set in a bit
  }
}

# Only fire when a post whose title contains "GraphQL" is _created_
subscription {
  post(where: {
    mutation_in: [CREATED]
    node: {
      title_contains: "GraphQL"
    }
  }) {
    # ... we'll talk about the selection set in a bit
  }
}
```

### Exploring the selection set of a subscription

You now have a good understanding how you can subscribe to the events that interest you. But how can you now ask for the data related to an event?

The `PostSubscriptionPayload` type defines the fields which you can request in a `post` subscription. Here is what it looks like:

```graphql
type PostSubscriptionPayload {
  mutation: MutationType!
  node: Post
  updatedFields: [String!]
  previousValues: PostPreviousValues
}
```

Here's an overview of the values for each field according to the event that triggered the subscription:

`mutation` | `node` | `previousValues` | `updatedFields` | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CREATE` | The created node  | `null` | `null` |
| `UPDATE` | The new values of the updated node |  The values of the updated node _before_ the update | A list of strings with the names of the fields that were updated |
| `DELETE` | `null` | The deleted node | `null` 

In the following, each field is discussed in more detail.

##### mutation

The `mutation` field has the type `MutationType`. `MutationType` is an `enum` with three values:

```graphql
enum MutationType {
  CREATED
  UPDATED
  DELETED
}
```

The `mutation` field on the `PostSubscriptionPayload` type therefore carries the information what _kind_ of mutation happened.

##### node

The `node` field has the `Post` type. It represents the `Post` element which was _created_ or _updated_ and lets you retrieve further information about it.

Notice that for `DELETED`-mutations, `node` will always be `null`. If you need to know more details about deleted `Post` node, you can use the `previousValues` field instead (more about that soon).

##### updatedFields

`updatedFields` is of type `[String!]`.

One piece of information you might be interested in for `UPDATED`-mutations is which _fields_ have been updated with a mutation. That’s what the `updatedFields` field is used for.

Assume a client has subscribed to the Prisma API with the following subscription:

```graphql
subscription {
  post {
    updatedFields
  }
}
```

Now, assume the server receives the following mutation to update the `title` of a given `Post`:

```graphql
mutation {
  updatePost(
    where: {
      id: "..."
    }
    data: {
      title: "Prisma is the best way to build GraphQL servers"
    }
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```

The subscribed client will then receive the following payload:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "post": {
      "updatedFields": ["title"]
    }
  }
}
```

This is because the mutation only updated the `Post` node's `title` field - nothing else.

##### previousValues

`previousValues` is of type `PostPreviousValues`. This type looks very similar to `Post` itself:

```graphql
type PostPreviousValues {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
}
```

It basically is a _helper_ type mirroring the fields from `Post`.

`previousValues` is only used for `UPDATED`- and `DELETED`-mutations. For `CREATED`-mutations, it will always be `null` (for the same reason that node is `null` for `DELETED`-mutations).

##### Putting everything together

Consider again the sample `updatePost` mutation from before. But now assume, the subscription query includes _all_ the fields we just discussed:

```graphql
subscription {
  post {
    mutation
    updatedFields
    node {
      title
    }
    previousValues {
      title
    }
  }
}
```

Here’s what the payload will look like that the server pushes to the client after it performed the mutation from before:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "post": {
      "mutation": "UPDATED",
      "updatedFields": ["title"],
      "node": {
        "title": "Prisma is the best way to build GraphQL servers",
      },
      "previousValues": {
        "title": "GraphQL servers are best built with conventional ORMs",
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note that this assumes the updated `Post` had the following `title` before the mutation was performed: `“GraphQL servers are best built with conventional ORMs”`.

## Object subscriptions

For every available [object type](knul#object-types) in your datamodel, one object subscription is automatically generated.

### Subscribing to created nodes

For a given type, you can subscribe to all nodes that are being created using the generated object subscription.

#### Subscribe to all created nodes

To subscribe to created nodes of a certain type, you can use the generated object subscription and specify the `mutation_in: [CREATED]` filter for the `where` argument.

**Subscribe to created `Post` nodes:**

```graphql
subscription {
  post(where: {
    mutation_in: [CREATED]
  }) {
    mutation
    node {
      description
      imageUrl
      author {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Subscribe to specific created nodes using filters

You can make use of a similar [filter system as for queries](qwe1#filtering) using the `node` argument of the `where` object.

**Subscribe to created `Post` nodes of a specific `author`:**

```graphql
subscription {
  post(where: {
    AND: [
      {
        mutation_in: [CREATED]
      }, {
      node: {
        author: {
          id: "cj03x3nacox6m0119755kmcm3"
        }
      }
    ]
  }) {
    mutation
    node {
      description
      imageUrl
      author {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Subscribing to deleted nodes

To subscribe to deleted nodes of a certain type, you can use the generated object subscription and specify the `mutation_in: [DELETED]` filter for the `where` argument.

#### Subscribe to all deleted nodes

**Subscribe to deleted `Post` nodes:**

```graphql
subscription deletePost {
  post(where: {
    mutation_in: [DELETED]
  }) {
    mutation
    previousValues {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

#### Subscribe to specific deleted nodes

You can make use of a similar [filter system as for queries](knul#filtering) using the `node` argument of the `where` object.

**Subscribe to deleted `Post` nodes where the `title` contains a certain string:**

```graphql
subscription {
  post(where: {
    mutation_in: [DELETED]
    node: {
      title_contains: "GraphQL"
    }
  }) {
    mutation
    previousValues {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

### Subscribing to updated nodes

To subscribe to updated nodes of a certain type, you can use the generated object subscription and specify the `mutation_in: [UPDATED]` filter for the `where` argument.

#### Subscribe to all updated nodes

**Subscribe to updated `Post` nodes:**

```graphql
subscription {
  post(where: {
    mutation_in: [UPDATED]
  }) {
    mutation
    updatedFields
    node {
      description
      imageUrl
    }
    previousValues {
      description
      imageUrl
    }
  }
}
```

#### Subscribe to specific field updates

**Subscribe to events where the `description` field of a `Post` node gets updated:**

```graphql
subscription {
  post(where: {
    mutation_in: [UPDATED]
    updatedFields_contains: "description"
  }) {
    mutation
    node {
      description
    }
    updatedFields
    previousValues {
      description
    }
  }
}
```

Similarly to `updatedFields_contains`, more filter conditions exist:

- `updatedFields_contains_every: [String!]`: Matches if all fields specified have been updated.
- `updatedFields_contains_some: [String!]`: Matches if some of the specified fields have been updated.

**Subscribe to events where the `description` _and_ `published` fields of a `Post` node gets updated:**

```graphql
subscription {
  post(where: {
    mutation_in: [UPDATED]
    updatedFields_contains_every: ["description", "published"]
  }) {
    mutation
    node {
      description
    }
    updatedFields
    previousValues {
      description
    }
  }
}
```


**Subscribe to events where the `description` _or_ `published` fields of a `Post` node gets updated:**

```graphql
subscription {
  post(where: {
    mutation_in: [UPDATED]
    updatedFields_contains_some: ["description", "published"]
  }) {
    mutation
    node {
      description
    }
    updatedFields
    previousValues {
      description
    }
  }
}
```

<Warning>

It is not possible to use the `updatedFields` filter together with `mutation_in: [CREATED]` or `mutation_in: [DELETED]` as it only applied to `UPDATE` events!

</Warning>

## Relation subscriptions

Currently, subscriptions for relation updates are only available with a workaround using `UPDATED` subscriptions.

You can force a notification by "touching" nodes. Add a `dummy: String` field to the type in question and update this field for the node whose relation status just changed.

```graphql
mutation updatePost {
  updatePost(
    where: {
      id: "some-id"
    }
    data: {
      dummy: "dummy" # do a dummy change to trigger update subscription
    }
  )
}
```

## Overview

### How are queries in the Prisma API generated?

The GraphQL API of a Prisma service is specified in the Prisma GraphQL schema. The Prisma GraphQL schema is auto-generated based on the service's datamodel:

![](https://i.imgur.com/jHkNjKU.png)

The `Query` type of the Prisma GraphQL schema defines all the queries the Prisma API accepts.

As an example, consider the following datamodel:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @unique
  name: String!
}
```

This is the `Query` type Prisma will generate:

```graphql
type Query {
  users(where: UserWhereInput, orderBy: UserOrderByInput, skip: Int, after: String, before: String, first: Int, last: Int): [User]!
  user(where: UserWhereUniqueInput!): User
  usersConnection(where: UserWhereInput, orderBy: UserOrderByInput, skip: Int, after: String, before: String, first: Int, last: Int): UserConnection!
}
```

For every type in your datamodel, three queries are generated. Taking above the above `User` type as an example, these queries are:

- `user`: Retrieve a single `User` node
- `users`: Retrieve a list of `User` nodes (as an object query)
- `usersConnection`: Retrieve a list of `User` nodes (as a connection query)

To inspect all the available operations of your Prisma API in detail, you can read the Prisma GraphQL schema of your Prisma service. It can be downloaded with the [GraphQL CLI](https://github.com/graphql-cli/graphql-cli):

```bash
graphql get-schema --endpoint __YOUR_PRISMA_ENDPOINT__ --output prisma.graphql --no-all
```

Another way to learn about the concrete capabilities of your Prisma API is by exploring the auto-generated API documentation inside a GraphQL Playground. You can do so by clicking the green **SCHEMA**-button at the right edge of the Playground:

### Datamodel for examples on this page

All example queries on this page are based on a Prisma service configured with this datamodel:

```graphql
type Post {
  id: ID! @unique
  title: String!
  published: Boolean!
  author: User!
}

type User {
  id: ID! @unique
  age: Int
  email: String! @unique
  name: String!
  accessRole: AccessRole
  posts: [Post!]!
}

enum AccessRole {
  USER
  ADMIN
}
```


## Query concepts

The Prisma API offers two kinds of queries:

* **Object queries**: Fetch _single_ or _multiple_ nodes of a certain [object type](knul#object-types).
* **Connection queries**: Expose advanced features like _aggregations_ and [Relay compliant connections](https://facebook.github.io/relay/graphql/connections.htm) enabling a powerful pagination model.

When working with the Prisma API, the following concepts are also useful to keep in mind:

* **Hierarchical (or _nested_) queries**: Fetch data across relations.
* **Query arguments**: Allow for filtering, sorting, pagination and more.

## Object queries

We can use object queries to fetch either a **single node**, or a **list of nodes** for a certain object type.

Here, we use the `posts` query to fetch a list of `Post` nodes. In the response, we include only the `id` and `title` of each `Post` node:

```graphql
query {
  posts {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

We can also query a specific `Post` node using the `post` query. Note that we're using the `where` argument to select the node:

```graphql
query {
  post(where: {
    id: "cixnen24p33lo0143bexvr52n"
  }) {
    id
    title
    published
  }
}
```

Because `User` is another type in our datamodel, `users` is another available query. Again, we can use the `where` argument to specify conditions for the returned users. In this example, we filter for all `User` nodes that have their `age` higher than `18`:

```graphql
query {
  users(where: {
    age_gt: 18
  }) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

This also works across relations. Here we're fetching those `Post` nodes that have an `author` with the `age` higher than `18`:

```graphql
query {
  posts(where: {
    author: {
      age_gt: 18
    }
  }) {
    id
    title
    author {
      name
      age
    }
  }
}
```

You can read more about [node selection here](vw4d#node-selection).

## Connection queries

Object queries directly return a list of nodes. In special cases, or when using advanced features, using **connection queries** is the preferred option. They are an extension of (and fully compliant with) [Relay connections](https://facebook.github.io/relay/graphql/connections.htm).

The core idea of Relay connections is to provide meta-information about the _edges_ in the data graph. For example, each edge not only has access to information about the corresponding object (the `node`) but also is associated with a `cursor` that allows to implement powerful, [cursor-based pagination](https://graphql.org/learn/pagination/#complete-connection-model).

Here, we fetch all `Post` nodes using the `postsConnection` query. Notice that we're also asking for the `cursor` of each edge:

```graphql
# Fetch all posts
query {
  postsConnection {
    edges {
      cursor
      node {
        id
        title
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Connection queries also expose **aggregation** features via the `aggregate` field:

```graphql
# Count all posts with a title containing 'GraphQL'
query {
  postsConnection(where: {
    title_contains: "GraphQL"
  }) {
    aggregate {
      count
    }
  }
}
```

> More aggregations will be added over time. Find more information about the roadmap [here](https://github.com/prisma/prismagraphql/issues/1312).

## Querying data across relations

Every available [relation](knul#relations) in your datamodel adds a new field to the queries of the two models it connects.

Here, we are fetching a specific `User` node, and all its related `Post` nodes using the `posts` field:

```graphql
query {
  user(where: {
    id: "cixnekqnu2ify0134ekw4pox8"
  }) {
    id
    name
    posts {
      id
      published
    }
  }
}
```

`user.posts` acts exactly like the top-level `posts` query in that it lets you specify which fields of the `Post` type you're interested in.

## Query arguments

Throughout the Prisma API, you'll find query arguments that you can provide to further control the query response. It can be either of the following:

- **Ordering**: Sorting nodes by any field value using `orderBy`
- **Filtering**: Selecting nodes in a query by scalar or relational filters using `where`
- **Pagination**: Slicing nodes in a query using `first` and `before`, `last` and `after`, and `skip`

These query arguments can be combined to achieve very specific query responses.

### Ordering

When querying all nodes of a type you can supply the `orderBy` argument for every scalar field of the type: `orderBy: <field>_ASC` or `orderBy: <field>_DESC`.

**Order the list of all `Post` nodes ascending by `title`:**

```graphql
query {
  posts(orderBy: title_ASC) {
    id
    title
    published
  }
}
```

**Order the list of all `Post` nodes descending by `published`:**

```graphql
query {
  posts(orderBy: published_DESC) {
    id
    title
    published
  }
}
```

The field you are ordering by does not have to be selected in the actual query. If you do not specify an ordering, the response is automatically ordered ascending by the `id` field.

<Warning>

It's currently not possible to order responses [by multiple fields](https://github.com/prismagraphql/feature-requests/issues/62) or [by related fields](https://github.com/prismagraphql/feature-requests/issues/95). Join the discussion in the feature requests if you're interested in these features!

</Warning>

### Filtering

When querying all nodes of a type you can supply different parameters to the `where` argument to constrain the data in the response according to your requirements. The available options depend on the scalar and relational fields defined on the type in question.

#### Applying single filters

If you supply exactly one parameter to the `where` argument, the query response will only contain nodes that adhere to this constraint. Multiple filters can be combined using `AND` and/or `OR`, see [below](#arbitrary-combination-of-filters-with-and-and-or) for more.

##### Filtering by a concrete value

The easiest way to filter a query response is by supplying a concrete value for a certain field to filter by.

**Query all `Post` nodes that are not yet `published`:**

```graphql
query {
  posts(where: {
    published: false
  }) {
    id
    title
    published
  }
}
```

**Query all `User` nodes with a specific `name`:**

```graphql
query {
  users(where: {
    name: "Alice"
  }) {
    id
  }
}
```

**Query all `User` nodes with a specific `age`:**

```graphql
query {
  users(where: {
    age: 30
  }) {
    id
  }
}
```

##### Advanced filter criteria

Depending on the _type_ of the field you want to filter by, you have access to different advanced criteria you can use to filter your query response.

**Query all `Post` nodes whose `title` is in a given list of strings:**

```graphql
query {
  posts(where: {
    title_in: ["My biggest Adventure", "My latest Hobbies"]
  }) {
    id
    title
    published
  }
}
```

**Query all `User` nodes whose `age` is less than 42**:

```graphql
query {
  users(where: {
    age_lt: 42
  }) {
    id
  }
}
```

#### Relation filters

For _to-one_ relations, you can define conditions on the related node by nesting the according argument in `where`.

**Query all `Post` nodes where the `author` has the `USER` access role:**

```graphql
query {
  posts(where: {
    author: {
      accessRole: USER
    }
  }) {
    title
  }
}
```

For _to-many_ relations, three additional arguments are available: `every`, `some` and `none`, to define that a condition should match `every`, `some` or `none` related nodes.

**Query all `User` nodes that have _at least_ one `Post` node that's `published`:**

```graphql
query {
  users(where: {
    posts_some: {
      published: true
    }
  }) {
    id
    posts {
      published
    }
  }
}
```

Relation filters are also available in the nested arguments for _to-one_ or _to-many_ relations.

**Query all `User` nodes that did not _like_ a `Post` of an `author` in the `ADMIN` access role:**

```graphql
query {
  users(where: {
    likedPosts_none: {
      author: {
        accessRole: ADMIN
      }
    }
  }) {
    name
  }
}
```

> `likedPosts` is not part of the above mentioned datamodel but can easily be added by adding the corresponding field to the `User` type: `likedPosts: [Post!]! @relation(name: "LikedPosts")`. We also provide a `name` for the relation to resolve the ambiguity we would otherwise create because there are two relation fields targetting `Post` on the `User` type.

#### Combining multiple filters

You can use the filter combinators `OR`, `AND` and `NOT` to create an arbitrary logical combination of filter conditions:

- For an `AND`-filter to evaluate to `true`, _all_ of the nested conditions have to be `true`.
- For an `OR`-filter to evaluate to `true`, _at least one_ of the nested conditions has to be `true`.
- For a `NOT`-filter to evaluate to `true`, all of the nested conditions have to be `false`.

##### Using `OR`, `AND` and `NOT`

Let's start with an easy example:

**Query all `Post` nodes that are `published` _and_ whose `title` is in a given list of strings:**

```graphql
query {
  posts(where: {
    AND: [{
      title_in: ["My biggest Adventure", "My latest Hobbies"]
    }, {
      published: true
    }]
  }) {
    id
    title
    published
  }
}
```

`OR`, `AND` and `NOT` each accept a _list_ as input where each list item is an object and therefore needs to be wrapped with curly braces. The sample filter condition from the above query contains two filter objects:

- `{title_in: ["My biggest Adventure", "My latest Hobbies"]}`
- `{published: true}`

Only if both filter conditions are true for a `Post` node, that node will be included in the response.

##### Arbitrary combination of filters with `AND`, `OR` and `NOT`

You can combine and even nest the filter combinators `AND`, `OR` and `NOT` to create arbitrary logical combinations of filter conditions.

**Query all `Post` nodes that are either `published` _and_ whose `title` is in a list of given strings, _or_ have the specific `id` we supply:**

```graphql
query {
  posts(where: {
    OR: [{
      AND: [{
        title_in: ["My biggest Adventure", "My latest Hobbies"]
      }, {
        published: true
      }]
    }, {
      id: "cixnen24p33lo0143bexvr52n"
    }]
  }) {
    id
    title
    published
  }
}
```

Notice how we nest the `AND` combinator inside the `OR` combinator.

#### Limitations

Currently, neither [**scalar list filters**](https://github.com/prismagraphql/feature-requests/issues/60) nor [**JSON filters**](https://github.com/prismagraphql/feature-requests/issues/148) are available. Join the discussion in the respective feature requests on GitHub.

## Pagination

When querying all nodes of a specific [object type](knul#object-types), you can supply arguments that allow you to _paginate_ the query response.

### Seeking forward and backward with `first` and `last`

Pagination allows you to request a certain _chunk_ of nodes. You can seek forwards or backwards through the nodes and supply an optional starting node:

- To seek **forward**, use `first`; specify a starting node with `after`.
- To seek **backward**, use `last`; specify a starting node with `before`.

You cannot combine `first` with `before` or `last` with `after`. If you do so in a query, `before` or `after` will simply be ignored and only `first` or `last` is applied (at the very beginning or end of the list, depending on which you're using).

Note that you can query for more nodes than exist without an error message.

### Skipping elements with `skip`

You can also skip an arbitrary amount of nodes in whichever direction you are seeking by supplying the `skip` argument:

- When using `first`, `skip` skips elements at the _beginning_ of the list
- When using `last`, `skip` skips elements from the _end_ of the list

### Examples

For the following examples, we're assuming a list of exactly 30 nodes:

  posts(first: 3) {
    id
    title
  }
}

query {
  posts(
    first: 5
    skip: 5
  ) {

  }
}
```

**Query the last 3 nodes (seeking _backward_)**:

query {
  posts(
    first: 5
    after: "cixnen24p33lo0143bexvr52n"
    skip: 3
  ) {
    id
    title
  }
}

    last: 3
    before: "cixnen24p33lo0143bexvr52n"
    skip: 5
  ) {
    id

  }
}
```

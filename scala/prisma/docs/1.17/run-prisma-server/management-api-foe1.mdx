## Overview

The Management API of a Prisma server is used to deploy and manage the Prisma services running on the server. It is available via the `/management` path of your Prisma server, e.g. `http://localhost:4466/management`.

## API Reference

The Management API exposes the following operations (you can find the full GraphQL schema of the Management API [here](https://gist.github.com/nikolasburk/a1421fc218f00b6f552cc455ae309af0)).

```graphql
type Query {
  """
  Shows the status of the next migration in line to be applied to the project.
  If no such migration exists, it shows the last applied migration.
  """
  migrationStatus(name: String!, stage: String!): Migration!

  """Shows all projects the caller has access to."""
  listProjects: [Project!]!

  """
  Shows all migrations for the project. Debug query, will likely be removed in the future.
  """
  listMigrations(name: String!, stage: String!): [Migration!]!

  """Gets a project by name and stage."""
  project(name: String!, stage: String!): Project!

  """Information about the server"""
  serverInfo: ServerInfo!

  """generates a token for the given project"""
  generateProjectToken(name: String!, stage: String!): String!
}

type Mutation {
  deploy(input: DeployInput!): DeployPayload
  addProject(input: AddProjectInput!): AddProjectPayload
  deleteProject(input: DeleteProjectInput!): DeleteProjectPayload
  setCloudSecret(input: SetCloudSecretInput!): SetCloudSecretPayload
}
```

<Warning>

Duye to legacy reasons, the Management API currently uses outdated terminology to refer to certain Prisma concepts. Most importantly, **Prisma services** are called **projects** (e.g. `listProjects`) and **Prisma servers** are called **clusters** in the terminology of the API.

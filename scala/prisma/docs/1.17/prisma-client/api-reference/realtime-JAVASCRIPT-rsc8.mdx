## Overview

The Prisma client lets you subscribe to database events and receive updates in realtime using the `$subscribe` property. For each model type in your [datamodel](knul), the Prisma client exposes one function on this property named after the model (but lowercased). Subscribing to this function means you're interested in [write](rsc6)-events (i.e. _create_, _update_, _delete_) for that model. You can provide a filter object that lets you further constrain the kind of events you want to receive updates for. The function returns an [async iterator](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-iteration) that emits an event any time one of the specified database event happens.

The `$subscribe` API is based on [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API).

### Examples

_Subscribe to "create" and "update" events for the `User` mode_:

```js
const createdAndUpdatedUserIterator = await db.$subscribe.user({
  mutation_in: ['CREATED', 'UPDATED']
}).node()
```

 _Subscribe to any write event for `User` models where the user has a an email-address that contains the string `gmail`_:

 ```js
const userIterator = await db.$subscribe.user({
  email_contains: `gmail` 
}).node()
```

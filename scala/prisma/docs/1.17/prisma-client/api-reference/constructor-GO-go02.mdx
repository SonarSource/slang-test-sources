## Overview

The `Prisma` constructor is used to create new instances of the Prisma client.

```go
New(options PrismaOptions) Client
```

`PrismaOptions` has the following properties (all are optional):

- `endpoint: string`: The endpoint of your Prisma service. If not provided, the Client will default to the `endpoint` that was specified in prisma.yml when the Client was generated. 
- `debug: boolean`: If set to `true`, each invokation of a method on the Prisma client will print the GraphQL query that is sent to the Prisma API to the console. **Default: `false`**.

### Examples

_Use default values for `endpoint` and `secret` that were specified in prisma.yml when the Client was generated_:

```go
db := prisma.New(nil)
```

_Override default values for `endpoint` and `secret` that had been specified in prisma.yml when the Client was generated_:

```go
client := prisma.New(&prisma.PrismaOptions{
  Endpoint: "http://localhost:4466/hello-world/dev",
  Debug: true,
})
```

## Goals

On this page, you will learn how to:

- Install the Prisma CLI
- Setup Prisma using Docker
- Introspect your existing database and derive a datamodel
- Use the datamodel to configure your Prisma API
- Generate a Prisma client
- Read and write data using the Prisma client

<Warning>

Using your existing database with Prisma currently only works when using **PostgreSQL** databases.

</Warning>

## Prerequisites

Make sure to have connection details for your database at hand. This includes the following pieces of information:

- **Host**: The host of your Postgres server, e.g. `localhost`.
- **Port**: The port where your Postgres server listens, e.g. `5432`.
- **User & Password**: The credentials for your Postgres server.
- **Name of existing _database_**: The name of the Postgres _database_.
- **Name of existing _schema_**: The name of the Postgres _schema_, e.g. `public`.

You also need to know whether your database server uses **SSL**.

## Install the Prisma CLI

The [Prisma CLI](alx4) is used for various Prisma workflows. You can install it using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/):

<Code languages={["Homebrew", "NPM"]}>

```bash copy
brew tap prisma/prisma
brew install prisma
```

```bash copy
npm install -g prisma@beta
```

</Code>

## Install Docker

To use Prisma locally, you need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed on your machine. If you don't have Docker yet, you can download the Docker Community Edition for your operating system [here](https://www.docker.com/community-edition).

> Don't want to use Docker? You can also get started with a [demo database](a001) for now.

## Set up Prisma server

### Create new directory

```bash copy
mkdir hello-world
cd hello-world
```

### Create Docker Compose file

To launch Prisma on your machine, you need a [Docker Compose file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/) that configures Prisma and specifies to which database it can connect:

```bash copy
touch docker-compose.yml
```

### Add Prisma Docker image

Paste the following contents into the Docker Compose file you just created:

<Code languages={["PostgreSQL", "MySQL"]}>

```yml copy
version: '3'
services:
  prisma:
    image: prismagraphql/prisma:1.16
    restart: always
    ports:
    - "4466:4466"
    environment:
      PRISMA_CONFIG: |
        port: 4466
        databases:
          default:
            connector: postgres
            host: __YOUR_POSTGRES_HOST__
            port: __YOUR_POSTGRES_PORT__
            database: __YOUR_POSTGRES_DB__
            schema: __YOUR_POSTGRES_SCHEMA__
            user: __YOUR_POSTGRES_USER__
            password: __YOUR_POSTGRES_PASSWORD__
            migrations: false
            ssl: __SSL_CONNECTION__
```

```yml copy
# Coming soon. See https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/2506
```

</Code>

### Specify database connection

To specify the database to which Prisma should connect, replace the placeholders that are spelled all-uppercased in the Docker Compose files with the corresponding values of your database:

- `__YOUR_POSTGRES_HOST__`: The host of your Postgres server, e.g. `localhost`.
- `__YOUR_POSTGRES_PORT__`: The port where your Postgres server listens, e.g. `5432`.
- `__YOUR_POSTGRES_DB__`: The name of your Postgres database.
- `__YOUR_POSTGRES_SCHEMA__`: The name of your Postgres schema, e.g. `public`.
- `__YOUR_POSTGRES_USER__`: The database user.
- `__YOUR_POSTGRES_PASSWORD__`: The password for the database user.
- `__SSL_CONNECTION__`: Whether your database server uses SSL, possible values are `true` and `false`.

### Start Prisma server

To start Prisma and launch the connected database, run the following command:

```bash copy
docker-compose up -d
```

Your local Prisma server is now running on `http://localhost:4466`.

## Derive Prisma datamodel from database schema

### Create prisma.yml

Next, you need to create a `prisma.yml`:

```bash copy
touch prisma.yml
```

Now add the following contents to it:

```yml copy
endpoint: http://localhost:4466
```

> The `endpoint` needs to match the URL of a running Prisma server.

### Introspect database

You now need to introspect your database schema to generate the datamodel which is the foundation for the API of your Prisma client:

```bash copy
prisma introspect
```

The CLI generates the `datamodel-[TIMESTAMP].graphql` (e.g. `datamodel-1533886167692.graphql`) file containing the SDL version of your database schema. On the first run, it also writes the `datamodel` property into the `prisma.yml`.

Finally, you need to rename the file to `datamodel.prisma` because that's the file name you specifed in `prisma.yml`.

## Deploy the Prisma API

You now have the _minimal_ setup to deploy your Prisma API. Run the following command (this does **not** change anything in your database):

```bash copy
prisma deploy
```

<Warning>

Launching the Prisma server may take a few minutes. In case the `prisma deploy` command fails, wait a few minutes and try again. Also run `docker ps` to ensure the Docker container is actually running.

</Warning>

## Generate your Prisma client

The Prisma client is a custom, auto-generated library that connects to your Prisma API. Append the following lines to the end of your `prisma.yml`:

```yml copy
generate:
  - generator: javascript-client
    output: ./prisma-client/
```

Now generate the client with this command:

``` copy
prisma generate
```

The CLI now stored your Prisma client inside the `prisma-client` folder as specified in `prisma.yml`.

## Prepare Node application

Run the following command to create an empty Node script:

```bash copy
touch index.js
```

Next, initialize an empty NPM project in the current directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash copy
npm init -y
npm install --save prisma-client-lib graphql@0.13
```

## Read and write data using the Prisma client

The API operations of the Prisma client depend on the datamodel that was generated from the database introspection. The following sample queries assume there is a `User` type in the datamodel defined as follows:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @unique
  name: String!
}
```

If you don't have such a `User` type, you need to adjust the following code snippets with a type that matches your datamodel.

Add the following code in `index.js` and save it afterwards:

```js copy
const { prisma } = require('./prisma-client')

// A `main` function so that we can use async/await
async function main() {

  // Create a new user called `Alice`
  const newUser = await prisma.createUser({ name: 'Alice' })
  console.log(`Created new user: ${newUser.name} (ID: ${newUser.id})`)

  // Read all users from the database and print them to the console
  const allUsers = await prisma.users()
  console.log(allUsers)
}

main().catch(e => console.error(e))
```

Execute the script with the following command:

```bash copy
node index.js
```

Whenever you run this script with that command, a new user record is created in the database (because of the call to `createUser`).

Feel free to play around with the Prisma client API and try out some of the following operations by adding the following code snippets to the file (at the end of the `main` function) and re-executing the script:

<QueryChooser titles={["Fetch single user", "Filter user list", "Update a user's name", "Delete user"]}>

```js lineNumbers,copy
const user = await prisma
  .user({ id: '__USER_ID__' })
```

```js lineNumbers,copy
const usersCalledAlice = await prisma
  .users({
    where: {
      name: 'Alice'
    }
  })
```

```js lineNumbers,copy
 const updatedUser = await prisma
  .updateUser({
    where: { id: '__USER_ID__' },
    data: { name: 'Bob' }
  })
```

```js lineNumbers,copy
 const deletedUser = await prisma
  .deleteUser({ id: '__USER_ID__' })
```

</QueryChooser>

> In some snippets, you need to replace the `__USER__ID__` placeholder with the ID of an actual user.

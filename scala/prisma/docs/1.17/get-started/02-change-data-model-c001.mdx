}

## Goals

On this page, you will learn how to:

- Adjust the datamodel and update your Prisma API
- Regenerate your Prisma client
- Create two database records in a single transaction
- Query relational data

<Warning>

This page is only relevant if you started with a [new database](a002) or a [demo server](a001). If you configured Prisma with an [existing database](a003), you need to run migrations directly against your database.

</Warning>

## Adjust your datamodel

Update the datamodel in `datamodel.prisma` as follows:

```graphql copy
type User {
  id: ID! @unique
  email: String @unique
  name: String!
  posts: [Post!]!
}

type Post {
  id: ID! @unique
  title: String!
  published: Boolean! @default(value: "false")
  author: User
}
```

Here's what changed:

- You added a new `email` field to the `User` type.
- You added a new `Post` type to the datamodel.
- You added a _relation_ between `User` and `Post` (via the `posts` and `author` fields).

## Redeploy your Prisma service

To apply the changes you just made to your datamodel, you need to redeploy the Prisma API:

```bash copy
prisma deploy
```

## Regenerate your Prisma client

Because the Prisma client is aware of your datamodel, you need to regenerate it every time after you deployed any changes to it:

```bash copy
prisma generate
```

The Prisma client library in the `prisma-client` folder is now being updated and its API has been adjusted to use your new datamodel.

## Read and write nested objects

The Prisma client API allows to write nested objects in a single transaction without having to manually control when the transaction starts or ends.

Update your `index.js` to look as follows:

```js copy
const { prisma } = require('./prisma-client')

// A `main` function so that we can use async/await
async function main() {

  // Create a new user with a new post
  const newUser = await prisma
    .createUser({
      name: "Bob",
      posts: {
        create: {
          title: "The data layer for modern apps",
        }
      },
    })
  console.log(`Created new user: ${newUser.name} (ID: ${newUser.id})`)

  // Read all users from the database and print them to the console
  const allUsers = await prisma.users()
  console.log(allUsers)

  const allPosts = await prisma.posts()
  console.log(allPosts)
}

main().catch(e => console.error(e))
```

Run the script with the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

## Query relational data

With the Prisma client API, you can navigate relations in your data graph using simple method calls. Here is how you can query the `posts` written by a certain `User`:

```js
const { prisma } = require('./prisma-client')

// A `main` function so that we can use async/await
async function main() {

  // Create a new user with a new post
  const newUser = await prisma
    .createUser({
      name: "Bob"
      email: "bob@prisma.io"
      posts: {
        create: {
          title: "The data layer for modern apps",
        }
      },
    })
  console.log(`Created new user: ${newUser.name} (ID: ${newUser.id})`)

  // Read the newly created user from the database and print their posts to the console
  const postsByUser = await prisma
    .user({ email: "bob@prisma.io" })
    .posts()
  console.log(`All posts by that user: ${postsByUser}`)

}

main().catch(e => console.error(e))
```

## Goals

On this page, you will learn how to:

- Install the Prisma CLI
- Setup Prisma using Docker
- Configure your Prisma API
- Generate the Prisma client
- Read and write data using the Prisma client

## Install the Prisma CLI

The [Prisma CLI](alx4) is used for various Prisma workflows. You can install it using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/):

<Code languages={["Homebrew", "NPM"]}>

```bash copy
brew tap prisma/prisma
brew install prisma
```

```bash copy
npm install -g prisma@beta
```

</Code>

## Install Docker

To use Prisma locally, you need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed on your machine. If you don't have Docker yet, you can download the Docker Community Edition for your operating system [here](https://www.docker.com/community-edition).

> Don't want to use Docker? You can also get started with a [demo database](a001) for now.

## Set up database and Prisma server

### Create new directory

```bash copy
mkdir hello-world
cd hello-world
```

### Create Docker Compose file

To launch Prisma on your machine, you need a [Docker Compose file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/) that configures Prisma and specifies the database it can connect to.

```bash copy
touch docker-compose.yml
```

### Add Prisma and database Docker images

Paste the following contents into the Docker Compose file you just created:

<Code languages={["MySQL", "PostgreSQL"]}>

```yml copy
version: '3'
services:
  prisma:
    image: prismagraphql/prisma:1.16
    restart: always
    ports:
    - "4466:4466"
    environment:
      PRISMA_CONFIG: |
        port: 4466
        databases:
          default:
            connector: mysql
            host: mysql
            port: 3306
            user: root
            password: prisma
            migrations: true
  mysql:
    image: mysql:5.7
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: prisma
    volumes:
      - mysql:/var/lib/mysql
volumes:
  mysql:
```

```yml copy
version: '3'
services:
  prisma:
    image: prismagraphql/prisma:1.16
    restart: always
    ports:
    - "4466:4466"
    environment:
      PRISMA_CONFIG: |
        port: 4466
        databases:
          default:
            connector: postgres
            host: postgres
            port: 5432
            user: prisma
            password: prisma
            migrations: true
  postgres:
    image: postgres:10.5
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: prisma
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: prisma
    volumes:
      - postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
volumes:
  postgres:
```

</Code>

> You can switch between **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL** by using the tabs above the code block.

### Start database and Prisma server

To start Prisma and launch the connected database, run the following command:

```bash copy
docker-compose up -d
```

Your local Prisma server is now running on `http://localhost:4466`.

## Configure your Prisma API

To bootstrap the configuration files for your Prisma client run the following command:

```bash copy
prisma init --endpoint http://localhost:4466
```

> The `endpoint` needs to match the URL of a running Prisma server.

## Deploy the Prisma API

The `prisma init` command created the _minimal_ setup needed to deploy the Prisma API: `prisma.yml` and `datamodel.prisma`. 

With these configuration files, you can now _deploy_ the Prisma API:

```bash copy
prisma deploy
```

Congratulations, you have successfully set up Prisma. You can now start using the Prisma client to talk to your database from code.

## Generate your Prisma client

The Prisma client is a custom, auto-generated library that connects to your Prisma API. Append the following lines to the end of your `prisma.yml`:

```yml copy
generate:
  - generator: javascript-client
    output: ./prisma-client/
```

Now generate the client with this command:

``` copy
prisma generate
```

The CLI now stored your Prisma client inside the `prisma-client` folder as specified in `prisma.yml`.

## Prepare Node application

Run the following command to create an empty Node script:

```bash copy
touch index.js
```

Next, initialize an empty NPM project in the current directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash copy
npm init -y
npm install --save prisma-client-lib graphql@0.13
```

## Read and write data using the Prisma client

Now add the following code to `index.js` and save it afterwards:

```js copy
const { prisma } = require('./prisma-client')

// A `main` function so that we can use async/await
async function main() {

  // Create a new user called `Alice`
  const newUser = await prisma.createUser({ name: 'Alice' })
  console.log(`Created new user: ${newUser.name} (ID: ${newUser.id})`)

  // Read all users from the database and print them to the console
  const allUsers = await prisma.users()
  console.log(allUsers)
}

main().catch(e => console.error(e))
```

Execute the script with the following command:

```bash copy
node index.js
```

Whenever you run this script with that command, a new user record is created in the database (because of the call to `createUser`). 

Feel free to play around with the Prisma client API and try out some of the following operations by adding the following code snippets to the file (at the end of the `main` function) and re-executing the script:

<QueryChooser titles={["Fetch single user", "Filter user list", "Update a user's name", "Delete user"]}>

```js lineNumbers,copy
const user = await prisma
  .user({ id: '__USER_ID__' })
```

```js lineNumbers,copy
const usersCalledAlice = await prisma
  .users({
    where: {
      name: 'Alice'
    }
  })
```

```js lineNumbers,copy
 const updatedUser = await prisma
  .updateUser({
    where: { id: '__USER_ID__' },
    data: { name: 'Bob' }
  })
```

```js lineNumbers,copy
 const deletedUser = await prisma
  .deleteUser({ id: '__USER_ID__' })
```

</QueryChooser>

> In some snippets, you need to replace the `__USER__ID__` placeholder with the ID of an actual user.

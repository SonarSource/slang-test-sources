  step: 3,
  nextText: 'Bonkerz! ðŸ’¯ With everything you learned so far, you\'re now able to build a GraphQL server with Prisma and Prisma bindings. Let\'s go!'
}

## Goals

On this page, you will learn how to:

- Download the GraphQL schema of your Prisma API using the GraphQL CLI
- Create a Prisma binding for your Prisma API
- Use the Prisma binding to send queries and mutations to your Prisma API

> The Prisma API is a GraphQL API that's served via HTTP. You can therefore consume it using any HTTP tool you like, such as `curl` or JavaScript's `fetch` ([learn more](nms2)). On this page, you're using [Prisma bindings](wer1) which provide a convenient abstraction on top of `fetch` to reduce boilerplate and improve the developer experience when working with Prisma. 

## Setup Node.JS project

For this tutorial, you'll use an extremely simple setup for your Node.JS app. Create your project in a directory called `myapp` using the following commands; note that `myapp` should _not_ be located _inside_ the `hello-world` directory which holds the service configuration of your service:

```bash copy
mkdir myapp
cd myapp
touch index.js
yarn init -y
```

## Install Prisma bindings

Go ahead and add the Prisma binding dependency to your project:

```bash copy
yarn add prisma-binding graphql
```

## Download the GraphQL schema of your Prisma API

When using Prisma bindings in your project, you need to have access to the auto-generated GraphQL schema of your Prisma API. 

Download the GraphQL schema using the following command from the [GraphQL CLI](https://github.com/graphql-cli/graphql-cli); you need to replace the `__YOUR_PRISMA_ENDPOINT__`-placeholder with the actual endpoint of your Prisma API (which you can find in your `prisma.yml`).

```bash copy
npx graphql get-schema --endpoint __YOUR_PRISMA_ENDPOINT__ --output prisma.graphql --no-all
```

The GraphQL schema is now stored in `prisma.graphql` (as specified in the `--output` parameter of the command).

## Instantiate Prisma API using Prisma bindings

Prisma bindings provide a convenient way to interact with Prisma APIs. Instead of manually constructing HTTP requests and sending them to Prisma, you can use the auto-generated binding functions to send queries and mutations.

## Instantiate a `Prisma` binding

It's time to write some code! Add the following snippet into `index.js`; like in the previous step you need to replace the `â‰¥__YOUR_PRISMA_ENDPOINT__`-placeholder with your actual endpoint:

```js copy
const { Prisma } = require('prisma-binding')

const prisma = new Prisma({
  typeDefs: 'prisma.graphql',
  endpoint: '__YOUR_PRISMA_ENDPOINT__'
})
```

## Use your Prisma binding to send queries and mutations

Add the following code snippet _after_ the code you have added in the previous step:

```js lineNumbers,copy
// send `users` query
prisma.query.users({}, `{ id name }`)
  .then(users => console.log(users))
  .then(() =>
    // send `createUser` mutation
    prisma.mutation.createUser(
      {
        data: { name: `Sarah` },
      },
      `{ id name }`,
    ),
  )
  .then(newUser => {
    console.log(newUser)
    return newUser
  })
  .then(newUser =>
    // send `user` query
    prisma.query.user(
      {
        where: { id: newUser.id },
      },
      `{ name }`,
    ),
  )
  .then(user => console.log(user))
```

<Collapse title="What does the code do?">

Here is a sequential overview of the tasks performed by the Node script:

1. Fetch all `User`s from the Prisma API using the `users` query (**line 2**):
  ```graphql
  query {
    users {
      id
      name
    }
  }
  ```
1. Print the data that was received from the Prisma API using `console.log` (**line 3**). 
1. Create a new `User` using the `createUser` mutation (**line 6**):
  ```graphql
  mutation {
    createUser(data: {
      name: "Sarah"
    }) {
      id
      name
    }
  }
  ```
1. Print the data of the newly created `User` that was received from the Prisma API using `console.log` (**line 13**).
1. Fetch the newly created `User` using the `user` query (**line 18**):
  ```graphql
  query {
    user(where: {
      id: $id # the `id` parameter is provided as `newUser.id` in the binding function
    }) {
      name
    }
  }
  ```

</Collapse>

## Execute the Node.JS script

To run the script and actually send the above queries and mutations to your Prisma service, run the following command:

```bash copy
node index.js
```

The expected output looks similar to this:

```
[]
{ id: 'cjjya4inyel970b296r43qwhn', name: 'Sarah' }
{ name: 'Sarah' }
```

If you already created some `User`s in your Prisma service, the array that's printed in the first line will not be empty.

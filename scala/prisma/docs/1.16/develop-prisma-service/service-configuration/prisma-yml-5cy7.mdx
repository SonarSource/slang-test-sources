## Overview

prisma.yml is the _root configuration file_ for a  Prisma service. Every Prisma service is defined by exactly one prisma.yml. You can think of prisma.yml as a _template_ for one Prisma service.

prisma.yml specifies a number of properties about the Prisma service, e.g.:

- the service's _endpoint_ (includes _name_ and _stage_ of the service)
- the _service secret_ used to authenticate requests made to the service's API
- the location of the _data model_ file(s)
- _hooks_ that specify shell commands to be executed at some point in the _deployment process_

## Examples

### Minimal example

The most minimal version of a valid prisma.yml needs to contains at least two properties:

- `datamodel`
- `endpoint`

To be able to specify an `endpoint`, you need to have access to a Prisma server. If you don't have access to a Prisma server, you can omit the `endpoint` from prisma.yml and run `prisma deploy` only with the `datamodel` property. In that case, a CLI wizard guides you through the process of creating a local Prisma server or lets you deploy to a Demo server in Prisma Cloud. It then writes the `endpoint` into prisma.yml for you before the service gets deployed:

```yml
datamodel: datamodel.graphql
```

### Standard example

The most commonly used properties in prisma.yml are:

- `datamodel`
- `endpoint`
- `secret`
- `hooks`

Here's what a standard prisma.yml with these properties might look like:

```yml
datamodel: datamodel.graphql
endpoint: http://localhost:4466/myservice/dev
secret: mysecret42
hooks:
  post-deploy:
    - graphql get-schema --endpoint http://localhost:4466/myservice/dev --output prisma.graphql
```


### Exhaustive example

Here's an example where all properties of prisma.yml are being used:

```yml
# This service is based on the type definitions in the two files
# databasetypes.graphql` and `database/enums.graphql`
datamodel:
  - database/types.graphql
  - database/enums.graphql

# The endpoint represents the HTTP endpoint for your Prisma API.
# It encodes several pieces of information:
# * Prisma server (`localhost:4466` in this example)
# * Service name (`myservice` in this example)
# * Stage (`dev` in this example)
# NOTE: When service name and stage are set to `default`, they
# can be omitted.
# Meaning http://myserver.com/default/default can be written
# as http://myserver.com.
endpoint: http://localhost:4466/myservice/dev

# The secret is used to create JSON web tokens (JWTs). These
# tokens need to be attached in the `Authorization` header
# of HTTP requests made against the Prisma endpoint.
# WARNING: If the secret is not provided, the Prisma API can
# be accessed without authentication!
secret: mysecret123

# A "post-deployment" hook that first downloads the GraphQL
# schema from an endpoint configured in `.graphqlconfig` and
# then invokes a code generation process.
hooks:
  post-deploy:
    - graphql get-schema --project db
    - graphql codegen

# This service has one event subscription configured. The
# corresponding subscription query is located in `database/subscriptions/welcomeEmail.graphql`.
# When the subscription fires, the specified `webhook`
# is invoked via HTTP.
subscriptions:
  sendWelcomeEmail:
    query: database/subscriptions/sendWelcomeEmail.graphql
    webhook:
      url: https://${self:custom.serverlessEndpoint}/sendWelcomeEmail
      headers:
        Authorization: ${env:MY_ENDPOINT_SECRET}

# Points to a `.graphql` file containing GraphQL
# operations that will be executed when initially
# deploying a service.
seed:
  import: database/seed.graphql

# This service only defines one custom variable that's
# referenced in the `webhook` of the `subscription`
custom:
  serverlessEndpoint: https://bcdeaxokbj.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/dev
```

This prisma.yml expects the following file structure:

```
.
│ .graphqlconfig
├── prisma.yml
└── database
    ├── subscriptions
    │   └── welcomeEmail.graphql
    ├── types.graphql
    └── enums.graphql
```


## Using variables

Variables allow you to dynamically replace configuration values in your prisma.yml. They are especially useful when providing _secrets_ for your service and when you have a multi-staging developer workflows.

To use variables inside prisma.yml, you need to reference the values enclosed in `${}` brackets:

```yml
yamlKeyXYZ: ${variableSource}
```

A _variable source_ can be either of the following two options:

- A _recursive self-reference_ to another value inside the same service (often used in combination with the `custom` property)
- An _environment variable_

> You can only use variables in property **values** - not in property keys. So you can't use variables to e.g. generate dynamic logical IDs in the custom resources section for example.

### Recursive self-reference

You can recursively reference other property values that live inside the same prisma.yml file.

When using a recursive self-reference as a variable, the value that you put into the bracket is composed of:

- the _prefix_ `self:`
- (optional) the _path_ to the referenced property; if no path is specified, the value of the variable will be the entire YAML file.

```yml
subscriptions:
  sendWelcomeEmail:
    query: database/subscriptions/sendWelcomeEmail.graphql
    webhook:
      url: https://${self:custom.serverlessEndpoint}/sendWelcomeEmail

custom:
  serverlessEndpoint: example.org
```

> This works for any property inside prisma.yml, not just `custom`.

### Environment variable

You can reference [environment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) inside the service definition file.

When using an environment variable, the value that you put into the bracket is composed of:

- the _prefix_ `env:`
- the _name_ of the environment variable

In the following example, an environment variable is referenced to specify the URL and the authentication token for a webhook:

```yml
subscriptions:
  sendWelcomeEmail:
    query: database/subscriptions/sendWelcomeEmail.graphql
    webhook:
      url: https://example.org/sendWelcomeEmail
      headers:
        Authorization: ${env:MY_TOKEN}
```

## Reference

### Root properties

The service definition file prisma.yml has the following root properties:

- `datamodel` (required): Type definitions for database models, relations, enums and other types.
- `endpoint`: HTTP endpoint for the Prisma API. Can be omitted to prompt CLI deployment wizard.
- `secret`: Service secret for securing the API endpoint.
- `hooks`: Define CLI commands to be executed before/after specific actions of the Prisma CLI.
- `subscriptions`: Configuration of subscription webhooks.
- `seed`: Points to a file containing mutations for data seeding.
- `custom`: Used to provide variables which can be referenced elsewhere in prisma.yml.

The exact structure of prisma.yml is defined with [JSON schema](http://json-schema.org/). You can find the corresponding schema definition [here](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-json-schema/blob/master/src/schema.json). The JSON schem definition also allows to elevate your tooling and let your code editors and IDEs help you with the right structure of prisma.yml.

### datamodel (required)

The `datamodel` points to one or more `.graphql`-files containing model definitions written in GraphQL SDL. If multiple files are provided, the CLI simply concatenates their contents at deployment time.

#### Type

The `datamodel` property expects a **string** or a **list of strings**.

#### Examples

The data model is defined in a file called `types.graphql`.

```yml
datamodel: types.graphql
```

The data model is defined in two files called `types.graphql` and `enums.graphl`. When the service gets deployed, the contents of both files will be concatenated by the CLI.

```yml
datamodel:
  - types.graphql
  - enums.graphql
```

### endpoint (optional)

The HTTP endpoint for your Prisma API is composed of the following components:

- **Prisma server**: The server that will host your Prisma service.
- **Workspace** (only for Demo servers in Prisma Cloud): The name of the Workspace you configured through Prisma Cloud.
- **Service name**: A descriptive name for your Prisma servic e.
- **Service stage**: The development stage of your cluster (e.g. `dev`, `staging`, `prod`).

Note that the `endpoint` is actually required to deploy your Prisma service. However, if you don't specify it in prisma.yml before running `prisma deploy`, the CLI prompts you with a wizard to help you figure out a Prisma server as deployment target and subsequently writes the `endpoint` into prisma.yml for you.

#### Type

The `endpoint` property expects a **string**.

#### Examples

The following example endpoint encodes the following information:

- **Prisma server**: `http://localhost:4466` means you're running a Prisma server locally on your machine (e.g. using Docker).
- **Service name**: `default`
- **Stage**: `default`

> When service name and stage are both set to `default`, they can be omitted and will be inferred by Prisma. This means this example endpoint is equivalent to writing: `http://localhost:4466/`

```yml
endpoint: http://localhost:4466/default/default
```

The following example endpoint encodes the following information:

- **Prisma server**: `https://eu1.prisma.sh` means you're using a Prisma Demo server as a deployment target for your Prisma service.
- **Workspace**: `jane-doe` is the name of your Prisma Cloud workspace.
- **Service name**: `myservice`
- **Stage**: `dev`

```yml
endpoint: https://eu1.prisma.sh/jane-doe/myservice/dev
```

The following example endpoint encodes the following information:

- **Prisma server**: `http://my-pr-Publi-1GXX8QUZU3T89-413349553.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com` means you're using a Prisma server hosted on AWS to deploy your Prisma service.
- **Service name**: `cat-pictures`
- **Stage**: `prod`

```yml
endpoint: http://my-pr-Publi-1GXX8QUZU3T89-413349553.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/cat-pictures/prod
```

### secret (optional)

The service secret is used to generate (or _sign_) authentication tokens ([JWT](https://jwt.io)). One of these authentication tokens needs to be attached to the HTTP requests made against the Prisma API exposes by the service (in the `Authorization` header field).

A secret must follow these requirements:

- must be [utf8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) encoded
- must not contain spaces
- must be at most 256 characters long

Note that it's possible to encode multiple secrets in this string, which allows for smooth secret rotations.

<Warning>

If the Prisma service is deployed without a `secret`, its API does not require authentication. This means everyone with access to the `endpoint` is able to send queries and mutations to the API and can therefore arbitrarily read and write to the database!

</Warning>

#### Type

The `secret` property expects a **string** (not a list of strings). If you want to specify multiple secrets, you need to provide them as a comma-separated list (spaces are ignored), but still as a single string value.

#### Examples

Define one secret with value `moo4ahn3ahb4phein1eingaep`.

```yml
secret: moo4ahn3ahb4phein1eingaep
```

Define three secrets with values `myFirstSecret`, `SECRET_NUMBER_2` and `3rd-secret`. Note that the spaces before the second secret are ignored.

```yml
secret: myFirstSecret,    SECRET_NUMBER_2,3rd-secret
```

Use the value of the `MY_SECRET` environment variable as the secret(s).

```yml
secret: ${env:MY_SECRET}
```

### hooks (optional)

The `hooks` property is used to define terminal commands which will be executed by the Prisma CLI before or after certain commands.

The following hooks are currently available:

- `post-deploy`: Will be invoked _after_ the `prisma deploy` command

#### Type

The `hooks` property expects an **object**. The properties of that object match the names of the currently available hooks.

#### Examples

Here is an example that performs three tasks after `prisma deploy` was executed:

1. Print "Deployment finished"
1. Download the GraphQL schema for the `db` project specified in `.graphqlconfig`
1. Invoke code generation as specified in `.graphqlconfig`

```yml
hooks:
  post-deploy:
    - echo "Deployment finished"
    - graphql get-schema --project db
    - graphql codegen
```

Note that this setup assumes the availability of a `.graphqlconfig` looking similar to this:

```yml
projects:
  db:
    schemaPath: generated/prisma.graphql
    extensions:
      prisma: prisma.yml
      codegen:
        - generator: prisma-binding
          language: typescript
          output:
            binding: src/generated/prisma.ts
```

### subscriptions (optional)

The `subscriptions` property is used to define all the subscription webhooks for your Prisma service. A subscription needs (at least) two pieces of information:

- a _subscription query_ that defines upon which event a function should be invoked and what the payload looks like
- the URL of a _webhook_ which is invoked via HTTP once the event happens
- (optionally) a number of HTTP headers to be attached to the request that's sent to the URL

#### Type

The `subscriptions` property expects an **object** with the following properties:

- `query` (required): The file path to the _subscription query_ (stored in a `.graphql`-file).
- `webhook` (required): Information (URL and optionally HTTP headers) about the webhook to be invoked. If there are no headers, you can provide the URL to this property directly (see first example below). Otherwise, `webhook` takes another object with properties `url` and `headers` (see second example below).

#### Examples

Specify one subscription without HTTP headers.

```yml
subscriptions:
  sendWelcomeEmail:
    query: database/subscriptions/sendWelcomeEmail.graphql
    webhook: https://bcdeaxokbj.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/dev/sendWelcomeEmail
```

Specify one event subscription with two HTTP headers.

```yml
subscriptions:
  sendWelcomeEmail:
    query: database/subscriptions/sendWelcomeEmail.graphql
    webhook:
      url: https://bcdeaxokbj.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/dev/sendWelcomeEmail
      headers:
        Authorization: ${env:MY_SECRET}
        Content-Type: application/json
```

### seed (optional)

Database seeding is a standardised way to populate a service with test data.

#### Type

The `seed` property expects an **object**, with either one of two sub-properties:

- `import`: Instructions to import data when seeding a service. You can refer to either of two kinds of files:
  - A path to a `.graphql` file with GraphQL operations.
  - A path to a `.zip` file that contains a data set in Normalized Data Format (NDF)
- `run`: Shell command that will be executed when seeding a service. This is meant for more complex seed setups that are not covered by `import`.

Seeds are implicitly executed when deploying a service for the first time (unless explicitly disabled using the `--no-seed` flag on `prisma deploy`). Track [this feature request for additional seeding workflows](https://github.com/graphcool/prisma/issues/1536).

#### Examples

Refer to a `.graphql` file containing seeding mutations:

```yml
seed:
  import: database/seed.graphql
```

Refer to a `.zip` file with a data set in NDF:

```yml
seed:
  import: database/backup.zip
```

Run a Node script when seeding:

```yml
seed:
  run: node script.js
```

### custom (optional)

The `custom` property lets you specify any sorts of values you want to reuse elsewhere in your prisma.yml. It thus doesn't have a predefined structure. You can reference the values using variables with the [`self` variable source](#self-reference), e.g.: `${self:custom.myVariable}`.

#### Type

The `custom` property expects an **object**. There are no assumptions about the shape of the object.

#### Examples

Define two custom values and reuse them in the definition of the event subscription.

```yml
custom:
  serverlessEndpoint: https://bcdeaxokbj.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/dev
  subscriptionQueries: database/subscriptions/

subscriptions:
  sendWelcomeEmail:
    query: ${self:custom.subscriptionQueries}/sendWelcomeEmail.graphql
    webhook: https://${self:custom.serverlessEndpoint}/sendWelcomeEmail
```

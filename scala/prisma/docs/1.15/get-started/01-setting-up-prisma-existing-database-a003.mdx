## Goals

On this page, you will learn how to:

- Install the Prisma CLI
- Start a local Prisma server using Docker
- Introspect your existing database and generate a service configuration
- Deploy a Prisma service to the local Prisma server
- Explore the Prisma API in a GraphQL Playground

<Warning>

Using your existing database with Prisma currently only works when using **PostgreSQL** databases.

</Warning>

## Prerequisites

Make sure to have connection details for your database at hand. This includes the following pieces of information:

- **Host**: The host of your Postgres server, e.g. `localhost`.
- **Port**: The port where your Postgres server listens, e.g. `5432`.
- **User & Password**: The credentials for your Postgres server.
- **Name of existing _database_**: The name of the Postgres _database_.
- **Name of existing _schema_**: The name of the Postgres _schema_, e.g. `public`.

You also need to know whether your database server uses **SSL**.

## Install the Prisma CLI

The [Prisma CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prisma) is used to deploy and manage Prisma services. You can install it using NPM:

```bash copy
npm install -g prisma
```

## Install Docker

To use Prisma locally, you need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed on your machine. If you don't have Docker yet, you can download the Docker Community Edition for your operating system [here](https://www.docker.com/community-edition).

## Set up Prisma server

### Create Docker Compose file

To launch a Prisma server on your machine, you need a Docker Compose file that configures the Prisma server and specifies to which database it can connect:

```bash copy
touch docker-compose.yml
```

### Add Prisma Docker image

Paste the following contents into the Docker Compose file you just created:

```yml copy
version: '3'
services:
  prisma:
    image: prismagraphql/prisma:1.15
    restart: always
    ports:
    - "4466:4466"
    environment:
      PRISMA_CONFIG: |
        port: 4466
        databases:
          default:
            connector: postgres
            host: __YOUR_POSTGRES_HOST__
            port: __YOUR_POSTGRES_PORT__
            database: __YOUR_POSTGRES_DB__
            schema: __YOUR_POSTGRES_SCHEMA__
            user: __YOUR_POSTGRES_USER__
            password: __YOUR_POSTGRES_PASSWORD__
            migrations: false
            ssl: __SSL_CONNECTION__
```

### Specify database connection

To specify the database to which your Prisma server should connect, replace the placeholders that are spelled all-uppercased in the Docker Compose files with the corresponding values of your database:

- `__YOUR_POSTGRES_HOST__`: The host of your Postgres server, e.g. `localhost`.
- `__YOUR_POSTGRES_PORT__`: The port where your Postgres server listens, e.g. `5432`.
- `__YOUR_POSTGRES_DB__`: The name of your Postgres database.
- `__YOUR_POSTGRES_SCHEMA__`: The name of your Postgres schema, e.g. `public`.
- `__YOUR_POSTGRES_USER__`: The database user.
- `__YOUR_POSTGRES_PASSWORD__`: The password for the database user.
- `__SSL_CONNECTION__`: Whether your database server uses SSL, possible values are `true` and `false`.

### Start Prisma server

To start the Prisma server and launch the connected database, run the following command:

```bash copy
docker-compose up -d
```

## Introspect your database

You now need to introspect your database schema to generate the data model for your Prisma service:

```bash copy
prisma introspect
```

In the interactive wizard, provide the same database connection details you specified in the Docker Compose file.

The CLI will generate the `datamodel-[TIMESTAMP].graphql` (e.g. `datamodel-1533886167692.graphql`) file containing the SDL version of your database schema.

## Deploy the Prisma service

### Create prisma.yml

Before deploying the Prisma service, you need to create a prisma.yml:

```bash copy
touch prisma.yml
```

Now add the following contents to it:

```yml copy
endpoint: http://localhost:4466
datamodel: __PATH_TO_YOUR_DATA_MODEL__
```

Replace the `__PATH_TO_YOUR_DATA_MODEL__` placeholder with the name of the file that contains the data model, e.g. `datamodel-1533886167692.graphql`.

### Deploy the service configuration to the local Prisma server

This service configuration now needs to be _deployed_ so you can use the Prisma API of your service:

```bash copy
prisma deploy
```

<Warning>

Launching the Prisma server may take a few minutes. In case the `prisma deploy` command fails, wait a few minutes and try again. Also run `docker ps` to ensure the Docker container is actually running.

</Warning>

## Explore the Prisma API in a Playground

The Prisma API of your service exposes CRUD and realtime operations for the types defined in your data model. You can explore the API in a [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prismagraphql/graphql-playground) using the following command:

```bash copy
prisma playground
```

The queries and mutations you can send depend on the data model that was generated from the database introspection. The following sample queries assume there is a `User` type in the data model defined as follows:

```graphql
type User @pgTable(name: "User") {
  id: Int! @unique
  name: String!
}
```

Depending on what your data model looks like, you can derive equivalent queries and mutations for your case. You can also use the auto-generated API documentation in the Playground to learn about the available API operations.

```graphql lineNumbers,copy
mutation {
  createUser(data: {
    name: "Alice"
  }) {
    id
  }
}
```

```graphql lineNumbers,copy
query {
  users {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

```graphql lineNumbers,copy
mutation {
  updateUser(
    where: { id: __USER_ID__ },
    data: { name: "Sarah" }
  ) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

```graphql lineNumbers,copy
mutation {
  deleteUser(where: {
    id: __USER_ID__
  }) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

</QueryChooser>

# The following types define the data model of the example app
# based on which the GraphQL API is generated

# All types need to have the three fields id, updatedAt and createdAt like this:

type User implements Node {
  id: ID! @isUnique
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
}


# Graphcool has one special type, the File type:
# Uncommenting this type will automatically enable the File API
# Read more here:
# https://www.graph.cool/docs/reference/api/file-management-eer4wiang0

# type File implements Node {
#   contentType: String!
#   createdAt: DateTime!
#   id: ID! @isUnique
#   name: String!
#   secret: String! @isUnique
#   size: Int!
#   updatedAt: DateTime!
#   url: String! @isUnique
# }

/**
 * Application lifecycle register.
 *
 * This is used to hook into Play lifecycle events, specifically, when Play is stopped. The reason Play only provides
 * lifecycle callbacks for stopping is that constructors are considered the application start callback.  This has
 * several advantages:
 *
 * - It simplifies implementation, if you want to start something, just do it in the constructor.
 * - It simplifies state, there's no transitional state where an object has been created but not started yet. Hence,
 * as long as you have a reference to something, it's safe to use it.
 * - It solves startup dependencies in a type safe manner - the order that components must be started is enforced by the
 * order that they must be instantiated due to the component graph.
 *
 * Stop hooks are executed when the application is shutdown, in reverse from when they were registered. Due to this
 * reverse ordering, a component can know that it is safe to use the components it depends on as long as it hasn't
 * received a shutdown event.
 *
 * To use this, declare a dependency on ApplicationLifecycle, and then register the stop hook when the component is
 * started. For example:
 *
 * {{{
 *   import play.api.inject.ApplicationLifecycle
 *   import javax.inject.Inject
 *
 *   class SomeDatabase @Inject() (applicationLifecycle: ApplicationLifecycle) {
 *
 *     private val connectionPool = new SomeConnectionPool()
 *     applicationLifecycle.addStopHook { () =>
 *       Future.successful(connectionPool.shutdown())
 *     }
 *
 *     ...
 *   }
 * }}}

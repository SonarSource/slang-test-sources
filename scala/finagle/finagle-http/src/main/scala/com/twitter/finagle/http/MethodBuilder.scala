/**
 * `MethodBuilder` is a collection of APIs for client configuration at
 * a higher level than the Finagle 6 APIs while improving upon the deprecated
 * [[ClientBuilder]]. `MethodBuilder` provides:
 *
 *  - Logical success rate metrics.
 *  - Retries based on application-level requests and responses (e.g. an HTTP 503 response code).
 *  - Configuration of per-attempt and total timeouts.
 *
 * All of these can be customized per method (or endpoint) while sharing a single
 * underlying Finagle client. Concretely, a single service might offer both
 * `GET statuses/show/:id` as well as `POST statuses/update`, whilst each having
 * wildly different characteristics. The `GET` is idempotent and has a tight latency
 * distribution while the `POST` is not idempotent and has a wide latency
 * distribution. If users want different configurations, without `MethodBuilder`
 * they must create separate Finagle clients for each grouping. While long-lived
 * clients in Finagle are not expensive, they are not free. They create
 * duplicate metrics and waste heap, file descriptors, and CPU.
 *
 * = Example =
 *
 * A client that has timeouts and retries on a 418 status code.
 * {{{
 * import com.twitter.conversions.time._
 * import com.twitter.finagle.Http
 * import com.twitter.finagle.service.{ReqRep, ResponseClass}
 * import com.twitter.util.Return
 *
 * val client: Http.Client = ???
 * client.methodBuilder("inet!example.com:80")
 *   .withTimeoutPerRequest(50.milliseconds)
 *   .withTimeoutTotal(100.milliseconds)
 *   .withRetryForClassifier {
 *     case ReqRep(_, Return(rep)) if rep.statusCode == 418 => ResponseClass.RetryableFailure
 *   }
 *   .newService("an_endpoint_name")
 * }}}
 *
 * = Timeouts =
 *
 * Defaults to using the StackClient's configuration.
 *
 * An example of setting a per-request timeout of 50 milliseconds and a total
 * timeout of 100 milliseconds:
 * {{{
 * import com.twitter.conversions.time._
 * import com.twitter.finagle.Http
 * import com.twitter.finagle.http.MethodBuilder
 *
 * val builder: MethodBuilder = ???
 * builder
 *   .withTimeoutPerRequest(50.milliseconds)
 *   .withTimeoutTotal(100.milliseconds)
 * }}}
 *
 * = Retries =
 *
 * Retries are intended to help clients improve success rate by trying
 * failed requests additional times. Care must be taken by developers
 * to only retry when it is known to be safe to issue the request multiple
 * times. This is because the client cannot always be sure what the
 * backend service has done. An example of a request that is safe to
 * retry would be a read-only request.
 *
 * Defaults to using the client's [[ResponseClassifier]] to retry failures
 * [[com.twitter.finagle.service.ResponseClass.RetryableFailure marked as retryable]].
 * See [[withRetryForClassifier]] for details.
 *
 * A [[com.twitter.finagle.service.RetryBudget]] is used to prevent retries from overwhelming
 * the backend service. The budget is shared across clients created from
 * an initial `MethodBuilder`. As such, even if the retry rules
 * deem the request retryable, it may not be retried if there is insufficient
 * budget.
 *
 * Finagle will automatically retry failures that are known to be safe
 * to retry via [[com.twitter.finagle.service.RequeueFilter]]. This includes
 * [[com.twitter.finagle.WriteException WriteExceptions]] and
 * [[com.twitter.finagle.FailureFlags.Retryable retryable nacks]]. As these should have
 * already been retried, we avoid retrying them again by ignoring them at this layer.
 *
 * Additional information regarding retries can be found in the
 * [[https://twitter.github.io/finagle/guide/Clients.html#retries user guide]].
 *
 * The classifier is also used to determine the logical success metrics of
 * the method. Logical here means after any retries are run. For example
 * should a request result in retryable failure on the first attempt, but
 * succeed upon retry, this is exposed through metrics as a success.
 * Logical success rate metrics are scoped to
 * "clnt/your_client_label/method_name/logical" and get "success" and
 * "requests" counters along with a "request_latency_ms" stat.
 *
 * Unsuccessful requests are logged at `com.twitter.logging.Level.DEBUG` level.
 * Further details, including the request and response, are available at
 * `TRACE` level.
 *
 * @see [[com.twitter.finagle.Http.Client.methodBuilder]] to construct instances.
 *
 * @see The [[https://twitter.github.io/finagle/guide/MethodBuilder.html user guide]].

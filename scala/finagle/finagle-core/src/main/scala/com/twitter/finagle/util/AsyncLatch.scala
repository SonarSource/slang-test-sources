/**
 * A construct providing latched, asynchronous execution of side-effecting
 * functions. [[com.twitter.finagle.util.AsyncLatch#await]] does not block, but
 * the execution of functions passed to it may be delayed. That is, because the
 * latch guarantees serial, non-concurrent execution, functions passed to
 * `await` may have to wait until both of the following conditions are met:
 *
 * 1. No other functions are being executed
 * 2. The latch's count is zero
 *
 * Thus, calling [[com.twitter.finagle.util.AsyncLatch#incr]] will cause
 * subsequent functions passed to [[com.twitter.finagle.util.AsyncLatch#await]]
 * to be delayed until the count is decremented to zero. Once the count is zero,
 * functions are executed in LIFO order, i.e., the reverse of the order in
 * which they are given to `await`.

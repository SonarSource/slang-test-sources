/**
 * Abstraction for interacting with the underlying I/O pipeline.
 *
 * The `ChannelHandle` provides tools for writing messages to the peer, an `Executor` which
 * provides single threaded behavior for executed tasks, and information about the peer and
 * state of the pipeline.
 *
 * All method calls on the `ChannelHandle` are guaranteed not to result in re-entrance into
 * the [[PushSession]] so long as these methods are called from within the `serialExecutor`.
 * Specifically, if a session invokes a method on the handle it will not result in a new event
 * reaching the session before the method call has returned. This avoids situations such as a
 * session performing a write and before the call returns a new inbound message arrives and
 * mutates session state in an unexpected way.
 *
 * All failures are fatal to the [[PushChannelHandle]] including write failures. Specifically,
 * any failure results in the `onClose` promise being completed with the exception in the
 * `Throw` pathway and the underlying socket will be closed.

/**
 * LoadBand is an aperture controller targeting a load band. `lowLoad` and `highLoad` are
 * thresholds used to adjust the aperture. Whenever the capacity-adjusted,
 * exponentially smoothed, load is less than `lowLoad`, the aperture is shrunk by
 * one serving unit. When it exceeds `highLoad`, the aperture is opened by one serving
 * unit.
 *
 * The upshot is that `lowLoad` and `highLoad` define an acceptable
 * band of load for each serving unit.
 *
 * There are several goals that the LoadBand controller tries to achieve:
 *
 * 1. Distributed clients should be able to converge on a uniform aperture size if
 * they are offered the same amount of load. The tighter the high and low bands, the
 * less "wiggle" room distributed clients have to diverge aperture sizes. This is an
 * important property to maintain, especially when using [[DeterministicAperture]], in
 * order to have a more uniform load distribution.
 *
 * 2. Large changes or oscillations in the aperture window size are minimized in order to
 * avoid creating undue resource (e.g. sessions) churn. The `smoothWindow` allows to
 * dampen the rate of changes by rolling the offered load into an exponentially weighted
 * moving average.

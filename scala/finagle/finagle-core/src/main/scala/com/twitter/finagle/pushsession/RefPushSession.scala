/**
 * Proxy [[PushSession]] which can update the underlying session.
 *
 * Thread safety considerations
 *
 * - `receive` is only intended to be called from within the serial executor, which is
 *   a general rule in all `PushSession` implementations.
 * - `updateRef` should be called only from within the handle's serial executor. This
 *   is to avoid race conditions between closing the underlying session (which happens
 *   in the serial executor) and replacing it with a new session: if replacing happens
 *   in the same thread, there is no need to worry about broadcasting close events
 *   from the old session to the new one.
 * - `close` and `status` are safe to call from any thread.

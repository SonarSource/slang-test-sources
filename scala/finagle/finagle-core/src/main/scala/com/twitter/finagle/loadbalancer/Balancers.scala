  /**
   * The aperture load-band balancer balances load to the smallest subset ("aperture") of
   * services so that the concurrent load to each service, measured over a window specified
   * by `smoothWin`, stays within the load band delimited by `lowLoad` and `highLoad`.
   *
   * The default load band configuration attempts to create a 1:1 relationship between
   * a client's offered load and the aperture size. Given a homogeneous replica set â€“ this
   * optimizes for at least one concurrent request per node and gives the balancer
   * sufficient data to compare load across nodes.
   *
   * Among the benefits of aperture balancing are:
   *
   *  1. A client uses resources commensurate to offered load. In particular,
   *     it does not have to open sessions with every service in a large cluster.
   *     This is especially important when offered load and cluster capacity
   *     are mismatched.
   *  2. It balances over fewer, and thus warmer, services. This enhances the
   *     efficacy of the fail-fast mechanisms, etc. This also means that clients pay
   *     the penalty of session establishment less frequently.
   *  3. It increases the efficacy of least-loaded balancing which, in order to
   *     work well, requires concurrent load. The load-band balancer effectively
   *     arranges load in a manner that ensures a higher level of per-service
   *     concurrency.
   *
   * @param smoothWin The time window to use when calculating the rps observed by this
   * load balancer instance. The smoothed rps value is then used to determine the size of
   * the aperture (along with the `lowLoad` and `highLoad` parameters).
   *
   * @param lowLoad The lower threshold on average load (as calculated by rps over
   * smooth window / # of endpoints). Once this threshold is reached, the aperture is
   * narrowed. Put differently, if there is an average of `lowLoad` requests across
   * the endpoints, then we are not concentrating our concurrency well, so we narrow
   * the aperture.
   *
   * @param highLoad The upper threshold on average load (as calculated by rps / #
   * of instances). Once this threshold is reached, the aperture is widened. Put differently,
   * if there is an average of `highLoad` requests across the endpoints, then we are
   * over subscribing the endpoints and need to widen the aperture.
   *
   * @param minAperture The minimum aperture allowed. Note, this value is checked to
   * ensure that it is not larger than the number of endpoints.
   *
   * @param maxEffort This is the fixed number of retries the LB is willing to make
   * if an unavailable node (Status != Open) is returned from the underlying pick.

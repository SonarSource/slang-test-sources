/**
 * Netty 4 implementation of the [[PushChannelHandle]]
 *
 * It is assumed that this stage is added after any necessary layer 4 handshakes such
 * as TLS negotiation as it will set the channel auto-read to `false`. If stages before
 * it require data after this channel has been installed but before it is ready they need
 * to manage their read interests accordingly. After the [[PushSession]] is installed
 * auto-read is set to `true` and this implementation won't request or modify the read
 * interests for the remainder of its lifecycle.
 *
 * @see [[com.twitter.finagle.netty4.ssl.client.Netty4ClientSslChannelInitializer]] for the tools
 *     used to initialize TLS and delay the connect promise until negotiation is complete.

/**
 * Encoder and decoder for mux contexts
 *
 * Contexts are encoded as length delimited pairs, with each the key and
 * the value being prefixed with its length. For example, the context entries
 * ['foo': 'bar', 'biz': 'bazz'] would be encoded as:
 * 0x0003'foo'0x0003'bar'0x0003'biz'0x0004'bazz'
 *
 * In the syntax describing the mux protocol, this is represented as
 * (ckey~2 cval~2){nc}
 * where 'nc' is determined by either a prior knowledge, such an explicit
 * count such as in the Tdispatch and Rdispatch messages, or by consuming
 * the entire data source such as in the case of application headers.

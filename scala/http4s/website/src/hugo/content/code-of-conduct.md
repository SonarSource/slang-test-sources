http4s is a [Typelevel] incubator project.  We hope that our community
will be respectful, helpful, and kind.  We are dedicated to providing
a harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of gender or
anything to do with it (identity, history, expression, non-binary
gender, etc.), sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
body size, race, religion, and programming background.

People are expected to follow the [Typelevel Code of Conduct] when
discussing http4s on [GitHub], [Gitter], and other venues provided by
the http4s project.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact a member of the
community staff, such as:

- [Bryce Anderson](mailto:bryce.anderson22@gmail.com)
- [Ross A. Baker](mailto:ross@rossabaker.com)

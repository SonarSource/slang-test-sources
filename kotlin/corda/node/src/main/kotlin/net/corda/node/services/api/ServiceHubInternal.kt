                    // The reason for this is three-fold:
                    //
                    // 1) We are putting in place the observer mode feature relatively quickly to meet specific customer
                    //    launch target dates.
                    //
                    // 2) The right design for vaults which mix observations and relevant states isn't entirely clear yet.
                    //
                    // 3) If we get the design wrong it could create security problems and business confusions.
                    //
                    // Back in the bitcoinj days I did add support for "watching addresses" to the wallet code, which is the
                    // Bitcoin equivalent of observer nodes:
                    //
                    //   https://bitcoinj.github.io/working-with-the-wallet#watching-wallets
                    //
                    // The ability to have a wallet containing both irrelevant and relevant states complicated everything quite
                    // dramatically, even methods as basic as the getBalance() API which required additional modes to let you
                    // query "balance I can spend" vs "balance I am observing". In the end it might have been better to just
                    // require the user to create an entirely separate wallet for observing with.
                    //
                    // In Corda we don't support a single node having multiple vaults (at the time of writing), and it's not
                    // clear that's the right way to go: perhaps adding an "origin" column to the VAULT_STATES table is a better
                    // solution. Then you could select subsets of states depending on where the report came from.
                    //
                    // The risk of doing this is that apps/developers may use 'canned SQL queries' not written by us that forget
                    // to add a WHERE clause for the origin column. Those queries will seem to work most of the time until
                    // they're run on an observer node and mix in irrelevant data. In the worst case this may result in
                    // erroneous data being reported to the user, which could cause security problems.
                    //
                    // Because the primary use case for recording irrelevant states is observer/regulator nodes, who are unlikely
                    // to make writes to the ledger very often or at all, we choose to punt this issue for the time being.

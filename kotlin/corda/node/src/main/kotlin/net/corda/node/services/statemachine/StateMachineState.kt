/**
 * The state of the state machine, capturing the state of a flow. It consists of two parts, an *immutable* part that is
 * persisted to the database ([Checkpoint]), and the rest, which is an in-memory-only state.
 *
 * @param checkpoint the persisted part of the state.
 * @param flowLogic the [FlowLogic] associated with the flow. Note that this is mutable by the user.
 * @param pendingDeduplicationHandlers the list of incomplete deduplication handlers.
 * @param isFlowResumed true if the control is returned (or being returned) to "user-space" flow code. This is used
 *   to make [Event.DoRemainingWork] idempotent.
 * @param isTransactionTracked true if a ledger transaction has been tracked as part of a
 *   [FlowIORequest.WaitForLedgerCommit]. This used is to make tracking idempotent.
 * @param isAnyCheckpointPersisted true if at least a single checkpoint has been persisted. This is used to determine
 *   whether we should DELETE the checkpoint at the end of the flow.
 * @param isStartIdempotent true if the start of the flow is idempotent, making the skipping of the initial checkpoint
 *   possible.
 * @param isRemoved true if the flow has been removed from the state machine manager. This is used to avoid any further
 *   work.
 * @param senderUUID the identifier of the sending state machine or null if this flow is resumed from a checkpoint so that it does not participate in de-duplication high-water-marking.

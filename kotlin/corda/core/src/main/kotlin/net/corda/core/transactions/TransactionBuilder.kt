/**
 * A TransactionBuilder is a transaction class that's mutable (unlike the others which are all immutable). It is
 * intended to be passed around contracts that may edit it by adding new states/commands. Then once the states
 * and commands are right, this class can be used as a holding bucket to gather signatures from multiple parties.
 *
 * The builder can be customised for specific transaction types, e.g. where additional processing is needed
 * before adding a state/command.
 *
 * @param notary Notary used for the transaction. If null, this indicates the transaction DOES NOT have a notary.
 * When this is set to a non-null value, an output state can be added by just passing in a [ContractState] â€“ a
 * [TransactionState] with this notary specified will be generated automatically.

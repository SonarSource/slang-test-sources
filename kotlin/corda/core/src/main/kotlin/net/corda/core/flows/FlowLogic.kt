/**
 * A sub-class of [FlowLogic<T>] implements a flow using direct, straight line blocking code. Thus you
 * can write complex flow logic in an ordinary fashion, without having to think about callbacks, restarting after
 * a node crash, how many instances of your flow there are running and so on.
 *
 * Invoking the network will cause the call stack to be suspended onto the heap and then serialized to a database using
 * the Quasar fibers framework. Because of this, if you need access to data that might change over time, you should
 * request it just-in-time via the [serviceHub] property which is provided. Don't try and keep data you got from a
 * service across calls to send/receive/sendAndReceive because the world might change in arbitrary ways out from
 * underneath you, for instance, if the node is restarted or reconfigured!
 *
 * Additionally, be aware of what data you pin either via the stack or in your [FlowLogic] implementation. Very large
 * objects or datasets will hurt performance by increasing the amount of data stored in each checkpoint.
 *
 * If you'd like to use another FlowLogic class as a component of your own, construct it on the fly and then pass
 * it to the [subFlow] method. It will return the result of that flow when it completes.
 *
 * If your flow (whether it's a top-level flow or a subflow) is supposed to initiate a session with the counterparty
 * and request they start their counterpart flow, then make sure it's annotated with [InitiatingFlow]. This annotation
 * also has a version property to allow you to version your flow and enables a node to restrict support for the flow to
 * that particular version.
 *
 * Functions that suspend the flow (including all functions on [FlowSession]) accept a maySkipCheckpoint parameter
 * defaulting to false, false meaning a checkpoint should always be created on suspend. This parameter may be set to
 * true which allows the implementation to potentially optimise away the checkpoint, saving a roundtrip to the database.
 *
 * This option however comes with a big warning sign: Setting the parameter to true requires the flow's code to be
 * replayable from the previous checkpoint (or start of flow) up until the next checkpoint (or end of flow) in order to
 * prepare for hard failures. As suspending functions always commit the flow's database transaction regardless of this
 * parameter the flow must be prepared for scenarios where a previous running of the flow *already committed its
 * relevant database transactions*. Only set this option to true if you know what you're doing.

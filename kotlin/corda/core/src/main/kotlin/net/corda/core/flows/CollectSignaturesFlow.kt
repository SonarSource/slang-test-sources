/**
 * The [CollectSignaturesFlow] is used to automate the collection of counterparty signatures for a given transaction.
 *
 * You would typically use this flow after you have built a transaction with the TransactionBuilder and signed it with
 * your key pair. If there are additional signatures to collect then they can be collected using this flow. Signatures
 * are collected based upon the [WireTransaction.requiredSigningKeys] property which contains the union of all the PublicKeys
 * listed in the transaction's commands as well as a notary's public key, if required. This flow returns a
 * [SignedTransaction] which can then be passed to the [FinalityFlow] for notarisation. The other side of this flow is
 * the [SignTransactionFlow].
 *
 * **WARNING**: This flow ONLY works with [ServiceHub.legalIdentityKey]s and WILL break if used with randomly generated
 * keys by the [ServiceHub.keyManagementService].
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * - Call the [CollectSignaturesFlow] flow as a [subFlow] and pass it a [SignedTransaction] which has at least been
 *   signed by the transaction creator (and possibly an oracle, if required)
 * - The flow expects that the calling node has signed the provided transaction, if not the flow will fail
 * - The flow will also fail if:
 *   1. The provided transaction is invalid
 *   2. Any of the required signing parties cannot be found in the [ServiceHub.networkMapCache] of the initiator
 *   3. If the wrong key has been used by a counterparty to sign the transaction
 *   4. The counterparty rejects the provided transaction
 * - The flow will return a [SignedTransaction] with all the counterparty signatures (but not the notary's!)
 * - If the provided transaction has already been signed by all counterparties then this flow simply returns the
 *   provided transaction without contacting any counterparties
 * - Call the [FinalityFlow] with the return value of this flow
 *
 * Example - issuing a multi-lateral agreement which requires N signatures:
 *
 *     val builder = TransactionBuilder(notaryRef)
 *     val issueCommand = Command(Agreement.Commands.Issue(), state.participants)
 *
 *     builder.withItems(state, issueCommand)
 *     builder.toWireTransaction().toLedgerTransaction(serviceHub).verify()
 *
 *     // Transaction creator signs transaction.
 *     val ptx = serviceHub.signInitialTransaction(builder)
 *
 *     // Call to CollectSignaturesFlow.
 *     // The returned signed transaction will have all signatures appended apart from the notary's.
 *     val stx = subFlow(CollectSignaturesFlow(ptx))
 *
 * @param partiallySignedTx Transaction to collect the remaining signatures for
 * @param sessionsToCollectFrom A session for every party we need to collect a signature from.  Must be an exact match.
 * @param myOptionalKeys set of keys in the transaction which are owned by this node. This includes keys used on commands, not
 * just in the states. If null, the default well known identity of the node is used.

/**
 * The [SignTransactionFlow] should be called in response to the [CollectSignaturesFlow]. It automates the signing of
 * a transaction providing the transaction:
 *
 * 1. Should actually be signed by the [Party] invoking this flow
 * 2. Is valid as per the contracts referenced in the transaction
 * 3. Has been, at least, signed by the counterparty which created it
 * 4. Conforms to custom checking provided in the [checkTransaction] method of the [SignTransactionFlow]
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * - Subclass [SignTransactionFlow] - this can be done inside an existing flow (as shown below)
 * - Override the [checkTransaction] method to add some custom verification logic
 * - Call the flow via [FlowLogic.subFlow]
 * - The flow returns the transaction signed with the additional signature.
 *
 * Example - checking and signing a transaction involving a [net.corda.core.contracts.DummyContract], see
 * CollectSignaturesFlowTests.kt for further examples:
 *
 *     class Responder(val otherPartySession: FlowSession): FlowLogic<SignedTransaction>() {

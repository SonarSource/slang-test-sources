 * using the [net.corda.core.messaging.CordaRPCOps.networkMapSnapshot] method.
 *
 * @property addresses An ordered list of IP addresses/hostnames where the node can be contacted.
 * @property legalIdentitiesAndCerts A non-empty list, where the first identity is assumed to be the default identity of the node.
 * @property platformVersion An integer representing the set of protocol features the node supports. See the docsite
 *           for information on how the platform is versioned.
 * @property serial An arbitrary number incremented each time the NodeInfo is changed. This is analogous to the same
 *           concept in DNS.

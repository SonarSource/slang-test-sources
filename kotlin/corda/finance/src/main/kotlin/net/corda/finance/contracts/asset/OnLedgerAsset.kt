/**
 * An asset transaction may split and merge assets represented by a set of (issuer, depositRef) pairs, across multiple
 * input and output states. Imagine a Bitcoin transaction but in which all UTXOs had a colour (a blend of
 * issuer+depositRef) and you couldn't merge outputs of two colours together, but you COULD put them in the same
 * transaction.
 *
 * The goal of this design is to ensure that assets can be withdrawn from the ledger easily: if you receive some asset
 * via this contract, you always know where to go in order to extract it from the R3 ledger, no matter how many hands
 * it has passed through in the intervening time.
 *
 * At the same time, other contracts that just want assets and don't care much who is currently holding it can ignore
 * the issuer/depositRefs and just examine the amount fields.

            // This code is analogous to the Wallet.send() set of methods in bitcoinj, and has the same general outline.
            //
            // First we must select a set of asset states (which for convenience we will call 'coins' here, as in bitcoinj).
            // The input states can be considered our "vault", and may consist of different products, and with different
            // issuers and deposits.
            //
            // Coin selection is a complex problem all by itself and many different approaches can be used. It is easily
            // possible for different actors to use different algorithms and approaches that, for example, compete on
            // privacy vs efficiency (number of states created). Some spends may be artificial just for the purposes of
            // obfuscation and so on.
            //
            // Having selected input states of the correct asset, we must craft output states for the amount we're sending and
            // the "change", which goes back to us. The change is required to make the amounts balance. We may need more
            // than one change output in order to avoid merging assets from different deposits. The point of this design
            // is to ensure that ledger entries are immutable and globally identifiable.
            //
            // Finally, we add the states to the provided partial transaction.

API: Vault Query
================

.. contents::

Overview
--------
Corda has been architected from the ground up to encourage usage of industry standard, proven query frameworks and
libraries for accessing RDBMS backed transactional stores (including the Vault).

Corda provides a number of flexible query mechanisms for accessing the Vault:

- Vault Query API
- Using a JDBC session (as described in :ref:`Persistence <jdbc_session_ref>`)
- Custom JPA_/JPQL_ queries
- Custom 3rd party Data Access frameworks such as `Spring Data <http://projects.spring.io/spring-data>`_

The majority of query requirements can be satisfied by using the Vault Query API, which is exposed via the
``VaultService`` for use directly by flows:

.. literalinclude:: ../../core/src/main/kotlin/net/corda/core/node/services/VaultService.kt
    :language: kotlin
    :start-after: DOCSTART VaultQueryAPI
    :end-before: DOCEND VaultQueryAPI
    :dedent: 4

And via ``CordaRPCOps`` for use by RPC client applications:

.. literalinclude:: ../../core/src/main/kotlin/net/corda/core/messaging/CordaRPCOps.kt
    :language: kotlin
    :start-after: DOCSTART VaultQueryByAPI
    :end-before: DOCEND VaultQueryByAPI
    :dedent: 4

.. literalinclude:: ../../core/src/main/kotlin/net/corda/core/messaging/CordaRPCOps.kt
    :language: kotlin
    :start-after: DOCSTART VaultTrackByAPI
    :end-before: DOCEND VaultTrackByAPI
    :dedent: 4

Helper methods are also provided with default values for arguments:

.. literalinclude:: ../../core/src/main/kotlin/net/corda/core/messaging/CordaRPCOps.kt
    :language: kotlin
    :start-after: DOCSTART VaultQueryAPIHelpers
    :end-before: DOCEND VaultQueryAPIHelpers
    :dedent: 4

.. literalinclude:: ../../core/src/main/kotlin/net/corda/core/messaging/CordaRPCOps.kt
    :language: kotlin
    :start-after: DOCSTART VaultTrackAPIHelpers
    :end-before: DOCEND VaultTrackAPIHelpers
    :dedent: 4

The API provides both static (snapshot) and dynamic (snapshot with streaming updates) methods for a defined set of
filter criteria:

- Use ``queryBy`` to obtain a current snapshot of data (for a given ``QueryCriteria``)
- Use ``trackBy`` to obtain both a current snapshot and a future stream of updates (for a given ``QueryCriteria``)
  
.. note:: Streaming updates are only filtered based on contract type and state status (UNCONSUMED, CONSUMED, ALL)

Simple pagination (page number and size) and sorting (directional ordering using standard or custom property
attributes) is also specifiable. Defaults are defined for paging (pageNumber = 1, pageSize = 200) and sorting
(direction = ASC).

The ``QueryCriteria`` interface provides a flexible mechanism for specifying different filtering criteria, including
and/or composition and a rich set of operators to include:

* Binary logical (AND, OR)
* Comparison (LESS_THAN, LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL, GREATER_THAN, GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL)
* Equality (EQUAL, NOT_EQUAL)
* Likeness (LIKE, NOT_LIKE)
* Nullability (IS_NULL, NOT_NULL)
* Collection based (IN, NOT_IN)
* Standard SQL-92 aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, COUNT)

There are four implementations of this interface which can be chained together to define advanced filters.

1. ``VaultQueryCriteria`` provides filterable criteria on attributes within the Vault states table: status (UNCONSUMED,
   CONSUMED), state reference(s), contract state type(s), notaries, soft locked states, timestamps (RECORDED, CONSUMED).

	.. note:: Sensible defaults are defined for frequently used attributes (status = UNCONSUMED, always include soft
	   locked states).

2. ``FungibleAssetQueryCriteria`` provides filterable criteria on attributes defined in the Corda Core
   ``FungibleAsset`` contract state interface, used to represent assets that are fungible, countable and issued by a
   specific party (eg. ``Cash.State`` and ``CommodityContract.State`` in the Corda finance module). Filterable
   attributes include: participants(s), owner(s), quantity, issuer party(s) and issuer reference(s).
	   
	.. note:: All contract states that extend the ``FungibleAsset`` now automatically persist that interfaces common
	   state attributes to the **vault_fungible_states** table.

3. ``LinearStateQueryCriteria`` provides filterable criteria on attributes defined in the Corda Core ``LinearState``
   and ``DealState`` contract state interfaces, used to represent entities that continuously supersede themselves, all
   of which share the same ``linearId`` (e.g. trade entity states such as the ``IRSState`` defined in the SIMM
   valuation demo). Filterable attributes include: participant(s), linearId(s), uuid(s), and externalId(s).
	   
	.. note:: All contract states that extend ``LinearState`` or ``DealState`` now automatically persist those
	   interfaces common state attributes to the **vault_linear_states** table.

4. ``VaultCustomQueryCriteria`` provides the means to specify one or many arbitrary expressions on attributes defined
   by a custom contract state that implements its own schema as described in the :doc:`Persistence </api-persistence>`
   documentation and associated examples. Custom criteria expressions are expressed using one of several type-safe
   ``CriteriaExpression``: BinaryLogical, Not, ColumnPredicateExpression, AggregateFunctionExpression. The
   ``ColumnPredicateExpression`` allows for specification arbitrary criteria using the previously enumerated operator
   types. The ``AggregateFunctionExpression`` allows for the specification of an aggregate function type (sum, avg,
   max, min, count) with optional grouping and sorting. Furthermore, a rich DSL is provided to enable simple
   construction of custom criteria using any combination of ``ColumnPredicate``. See the ``Builder`` object in
   ``QueryCriteriaUtils`` for a complete specification of the DSL.

    .. note:: Custom contract schemas are automatically registered upon node startup for CorDapps. Please refer to
       :doc:`Persistence </api-persistence>` for mechanisms of registering custom schemas for different testing
       purposes.

All ``QueryCriteria`` implementations are composable using ``and`` and ``or`` operators.

All ``QueryCriteria`` implementations provide an explicitly specifiable set of common attributes:

1. State status attribute (``Vault.StateStatus``), which defaults to filtering on UNCONSUMED states.
   When chaining several criterias using AND / OR, the last value of this attribute will override any previous
2. Contract state types (``<Set<Class<out ContractState>>``), which will contain at minimum one type (by default this
   will be ``ContractState`` which resolves to all state types). When chaining several criteria using ``and`` and
   ``or`` operators, all specified contract state types are combined into a single set

An example of a custom query is illustrated here:

.. literalinclude:: ../../node/src/test/kotlin/net/corda/node/services/vault/VaultQueryTests.kt
    :language: kotlin
    :start-after: DOCSTART VaultQueryExample20
    :end-before: DOCEND VaultQueryExample20
    :dedent: 12

.. note:: Custom contract states that implement the ``Queryable`` interface may now extend common schemas types
   ``FungiblePersistentState`` or, ``LinearPersistentState``.  Previously, all custom contracts extended the root
   ``PersistentState`` class and defined repeated mappings of ``FungibleAsset`` and ``LinearState`` attributes. See
   ``SampleCashSchemaV2`` and ``DummyLinearStateSchemaV2`` as examples.

Examples of these ``QueryCriteria`` objects are presented below for Kotlin and Java.

.. note:: When specifying the ``ContractType`` as a parameterised type to the ``QueryCriteria`` in Kotlin, queries now
   include all concrete implementations of that type if this is an interface. Previously, it was only possible to query
   on concrete types (or the universe of all ``ContractState``).

The Vault Query API leverages the rich semantics of the underlying JPA Hibernate_ based
:doc:`Persistence </api-persistence>` framework adopted by Corda.

.. _Hibernate: https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/jpa/2.1/api/

.. note:: Permissioning at the database level will be enforced at a later date to ensure authenticated, role-based,
   read-only access to underlying Corda tables.

.. note:: API's now provide ease of use calling semantics from both Java and Kotlin. However, it should be noted that
   Java custom queries are significantly more verbose due to the use of reflection fields to reference schema attribute
   types.

An example of a custom query in Java is illustrated here:

.. literalinclude:: ../../node/src/test/java/net/corda/node/services/vault/VaultQueryJavaTests.java
    :language: java
    :start-after: DOCSTART VaultJavaQueryExample3
    :end-before: DOCEND VaultJavaQueryExample3
    :dedent: 16

.. note:: Queries by ``Party`` specify the ``AbstractParty`` which may be concrete or anonymous. In the later case,
   where an anonymous party does not resolve to an X500 name via the ``IdentityService``, no query results will ever be
   produced. For performance reasons, queries do not use ``PublicKey`` as search criteria.

Pagination
----------
The API provides support for paging where large numbers of results are expected (by default, a page size is set to 200
results). Defining a sensible default page size enables efficient checkpointing within flows, and frees the developer
from worrying about pagination where result sets are expected to be constrained to 200 or fewer entries. Where large
result sets are expected (such as using the RPC API for reporting and/or UI display), it is strongly recommended to
define a ``PageSpecification`` to correctly process results with efficient memory utilisation. A fail-fast mode is in
place to alert API users to the need for pagination where a single query returns more than 200 results and no
``PageSpecification`` has been supplied.

Here's a query that extracts every unconsumed ``ContractState`` from the vault in pages of size 200, starting from the
default page number (page one):

.. container:: codeset

    .. sourcecode:: kotlin

        val vaultSnapshot = proxy.vaultQueryBy<ContractState>(
            QueryCriteria.VaultQueryCriteria(Vault.StateStatus.UNCONSUMED),
            PageSpecification(DEFAULT_PAGE_NUM, 200))

.. note:: A pages maximum size ``MAX_PAGE_SIZE`` is defined as ``Int.MAX_VALUE`` and should be used with extreme
   caution as results returned may exceed your JVM's memory footprint.

.. note:: ``otherResults`` will contain 12 items sorted from largest summed cash amount to smallest, one result per
   calculated aggregate function per issuer party and currency (grouping attributes are returned per aggregate result).

Dynamic queries (also using ``VaultQueryCriteria``) are an extension to the snapshot queries by returning an
additional ``QueryResults`` return type in the form of an ``Observable<Vault.Update>``. Refer to
`ReactiveX Observable <http://reactivex.io/documentation/observable.html>`_ for a detailed understanding and usage of
this type.

    :dedent: 12

Troubleshooting
---------------
If the results your were expecting do not match actual returned query results we recommend you add an entry to your
``log4j2.xml`` configuration file to enable display of executed SQL statements::

        <Logger name="org.hibernate.SQL" level="debug" additivity="false"> 
            <AppenderRef ref="Console-Appender"/> 
        </Logger>

Behavioural notes
-----------------
1. ``TrackBy`` updates do not take into account the full criteria specification due to different and more restrictive
   syntax in `observables <https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki>`_ filtering (vs full SQL-92 JDBC filtering as used
   in snapshot views). Specifically, dynamic updates are filtered by ``contractStateType`` and ``stateType``
   (UNCONSUMED, CONSUMED, ALL) only
2. ``QueryBy`` and ``TrackBy`` snapshot views using pagination may return different result sets as each paging request
   is a separate SQL query on the underlying database, and it is entirely conceivable that state modifications are
   taking place in between and/or in parallel to paging requests. When using pagination, always check the value of the
   ``totalStatesAvailable`` (from the ``Vault.Page`` result) and adjust further paging requests appropriately.

Other use case scenarios
------------------------

For advanced use cases that require sophisticated pagination, sorting, grouping, and aggregation functions, it is
recommended that the CorDapp developer utilise one of the many proven frameworks that ship with this capability out of
the box. Namely, implementations of JPQL (JPA Query Language) such as Hibernate for advanced SQL access, and
Spring Data for advanced pagination and ordering constructs.

The Corda Tutorials provide examples satisfying these additional Use Cases:

     1. Example CorDapp service using Vault API Custom Query to access attributes of IOU State
     2. Example CorDapp service query extension executing Named Queries via JPQL_
     3. `Advanced pagination <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/repository/PagingAndSortingRepository.html>`_ queries using Spring Data JPA_

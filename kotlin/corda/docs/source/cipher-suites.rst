Supported cipher suites
=======================

.. contents::

The set of signature schemes supported forms a part of the consensus rules for a Corda DLT network.
Thus, it is important that implementations do not support pluggability of any crypto algorithms and do take measures
to prevent algorithms supported by any underlying cryptography library from becoming accidentally accessible.
Signing a transaction with an algorithm that is not a part of the base specification would result in a transaction
being considered invalid by peer nodes and thus a loss of consensus occurring. The introduction of new algorithms
over time will require a global upgrade of all nodes.

Corda has been designed to be cryptographically agile, in the sense that the available set of signature schemes is
carefully selected based on various factors, such as provided security-level and cryptographic strength, compatibility
with various HSM vendors, algorithm standardisation, variety of cryptographic primitives, business demand, option for
post-quantum resistance, side channel security, efficiency and rigorous testing.

Before we present the pool of supported schemes it is useful to be familiar with :doc:`key-concepts-identity`,
:doc:`permissioning` and :doc:`api-identity`. An important design decision in Corda is its shared hierarchy
between the TLS and Node Identity certificates.

Certificate hierarchy
---------------------

A Corda network has 8 types of keys and a regular node requires 4 of them:

**Network Keys**

* The **root network CA** key
* The **doorman CA** key
* The **network map** key
* The **service identity** key(s) (per service, such as a notary cluster; it can be a Composite key)

**Node Keys**

* The **node CA** key(s) (one per node)
* The **legal identity** key(s) (one per node)
* The **tls** key(s) (per node)
* The **confidential identity** key(s) (per node)

We can visualise the certificate structure as follows (for a detailed description of cert-hierarchy,
see :doc:`permissioning`):

Supported cipher suites
-----------------------
Due to the shared certificate hierarchy, the following 4 key/certificate types: **root network CA**, **doorman CA**,
**node CA** and **tls** should be compatible with the standard TLS 1.2 protocol. The latter is a requirement from the
TLS certificate-path validator. It is highlighted that the rest of the keys can be any of the 5 supported cipher suites.
For instance, **network map** is ECDSA NIST P-256 (secp256r1) in the Corda Network (CN) as it is well-supported by the
underlying HSM device, but the default for dev-mode is Pure EdDSA (ed25519).

The following table presents the 5 signature schemes currently supported by Corda. The TLS column shows which of them
are compatible with TLS 1.2, while the default scheme per key type is also shown in the last column.

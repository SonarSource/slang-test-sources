/**
 * Global models store to allow decoupling of UI logic from stream initialisation and provide a central place to
 * inspect data flows. It also allows detecting of looping logic by constructing a stream dependency graph TODO do this.
 *
 * Usage:
 *  // Inject service -> client event stream
 *  private val serviceToClient: EventStream<ServiceToClientEvent> by Models.eventStream(WalletMonitorModel::serviceToClient)
 *
 * Each `Screen` code should have a code layout like this:
 *
 * class Screen {
 *   val root = (..)
 *
 *   [ inject UI elements using fxid()/inject() ]
 *
 *   [ inject observable dependencies using observable()/eventSink() etc]
 *
 *   [ define screen-specific observables ]
 *
 *   init {
 *     [ wire up UI elements ]
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * For example if I wanted to display a list of all USD cash states:
 *
 * class USDCashStatesScreen {
 *   val root: Pane by fxml()
 *
 *   val usdCashStatesListView: ListView<Cash.State> by fxid("USDCashStatesListView")
 *
 *   val cashStates: ObservableList<Cash.State> by Models.observableList(ContractStateModel::cashStates)
 *
 *   val usdCashStates = cashStates.filter { it.(..).currency == USD }
 *
 *   init {
 *     Bindings.bindContent(usdCashStatesListView.items, usdCashStates)
 *     usdCashStatesListView.setCellValueFactory(somethingsomething)
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * The UI code can just assume that the cash state list comes from somewhere outside. The initialisation of that
 * observable is decoupled, it may be mocked or be streamed from the network etc.
 *
 * Later on we may even want to move all screen-specific observables to a separate Model as well (like usdCashStates) - this
 * would allow moving all of the aggregation logic to e.g. a different machine, all the UI will do is inject these and wire
 * them up with the UI elements.
 *
 * Another advantage of this separation is that once we start adding a lot of screens we can still track data dependencies
 * in a central place as opposed to ad-hoc wiring up the observables.

# Grammar Development Extension for VSCode

A small VSCode extension for development of the Kotlin grammar.

> Note: The actual Kotlin support for VSCode, including the language client, is located in the [`vscode-kotlin` repository](https://github.com/fwcd/vscode-kotlin).

## Usage

The most convenient way to run the extension is to simply use the debug configuration `Run Grammar Dev` in this repo.

> Note: VSCode might show a warning that grammar paths are located outside of the extension folder. This message can be ignored, since the extension is only indended for development anyway.

/**
 * Testmarks allow easy navigation between code and tests.
 * That is, to find a relevant test for some piece of logic,
 * and to find the precise condition which is supposed to be
 * tested by a particular test. In a sense, testmarks are
 * a hand-made artisanal code-coverage tool.
 *
 * To use a testmark, first define a static [Testmark] value
 *
 * ```
 * val emptyFrobnicator = Testmark("emptyFrobnicator")
 * ```
 *
 * Then, use [hit] function in the "production" code
 *
 * ```
 * if (myFrobnicator.isEmpty()) {
 *     emptyFrobnicator.hit()
 *     handleEmptyFrobnicator()
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Finally, in the test case use [checkHit] function:
 *
 * ```
 * fun `test don't blow up on empty frobnicator`() = emptyFrobnicator.checkHit {
 *    arrange()
 *    act()
 *    assert()
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * You can `Cltr+B` on `emptyFrobnicator` to navigate
 * between code and tests. If after refactoring the
 * test fails to hit the testmark, you'll be notified
 * that the test might not work as it used to.
 *
 * Note that if testmark is used in "production", but
 * not in "test" code, it's useless, but we can't
 * provide a runtime assertion for this case.

//KT-5308 Wrong ExplicitReceiverKind when access to IntRange.EMPTY
fun test() {
    IntRange.<caret>EMPTY
}


Resolved call:

Resulting descriptor: val EMPTY: IntRange defined in kotlin.ranges.IntRange.Companion

Explicit receiver kind = DISPATCH_RECEIVER
Dispatch receiver = IntRange {Companion}
Extension receiver = NO_RECEIVER

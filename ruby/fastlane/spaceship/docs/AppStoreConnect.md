App Store Connect API
====================

# Usage

To quickly play around with _spaceship_ launch `irb` in your terminal and execute `require "spaceship"`.

In general the classes are pre-fixed with the `Tunes` module.

## Login

*Note*: If you use both the Developer Portal and App Store Connect API, you'll have to login on both, as the user might have different user credentials.

```ruby
Spaceship::Tunes.login("felix@krausefx.com", "password")

Spaceship::Tunes.select_team # call this method to let the user select a team
```

## Applications

```ruby
# Fetch all available applications
all_apps = Spaceship::Tunes::Application.all

# Find a specific app based on the bundle identifier or Apple ID
app = Spaceship::Tunes::Application.find("com.krausefx.app")
# or
app = Spaceship::Tunes::Application.find(794902327)

# Access information about the app
app.apple_id        # => 1013943394
app.name            # => "Spaceship App"
app.bundle_id       # => "com.krausefx.app"

# Show the names of all your apps
Spaceship::Tunes::Application.all.collect do |app|
  app.name
end

# Create a new app
app = Spaceship::Tunes::Application.create!(name: "App Name",
                                primary_language: "English",
                                         version: "1.0", # initial version
                                             sku: 123,
                                       bundle_id: "com.krausefx.app")
```

To update non version specific details, use the following code

```ruby
details = app.details
details.name['en-US'] = "App Name"
details.privacy_url['en-US'] = "https://fastlane.tools"
details.save!
```

To change the price of the app (it's not necessary to call `save!` when updating the price)

```ruby
app.update_price_tier!("3")
```

## AppVersions

<img src="/spaceship/assets/docs/AppVersions.png" width="500">

You can have up to 2 app versions at the same time. One is usually the version already available in the App Store (`live_version`) and one being the one you can edit (`edit_version`).

While you usually can modify some values in the production version (e.g. app description), most options are already locked.

With _spaceship_ you can access the versions like this

```ruby
app.live_version # the version that's currently available in the App Store
app.edit_version # the version that's in `Prepare for Submission` mode
```

You can then go ahead and modify app metadata on the version objects:

```ruby
v = app.edit_version

# Access information
v.app_status        # => "Waiting for Review"
v.version           # => "0.9.14"

# Update app metadata
v.copyright = "#{Time.now.year} Felix Krause"

# Get a list of available languages for this app
v.description.languages # => ["German", "English"]

# Update localized app metadata
v.description["en-US"] = "App Description"

# set the app age rating
v.set_rating({
  'CARTOON_FANTASY_VIOLENCE' => 0,
  'MATURE_SUGGESTIVE' => 2,
  'UNRESTRICTED_WEB_ACCESS' => 0
})
# Available values:
# https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/deliver/assets/example_rating_config.json
# https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/deliver/#reference (Open "View all available categories, languages, etc.")

# Push the changes back to the server
v.save!
```

**Important**: For a complete documentation with the return type, description and notes for each of the properties, check out [app_version.rb](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/spaceship/lib/spaceship/tunes/app_version.rb).

## Select a build for review

```ruby
version = app.edit_version

builds = version.candidate_builds
version.select_build(builds.first)
version.save!
```

## Build Trains (TestFlight)

<img src="/spaceship/assets/docs/BuildTrains.png" width="700">

To clarify:

- **version number**: Is set via the `CFBundleShortVersionString` property. It's the version number that appears on the App Store. (`0.9.21` on the screenshot)
- **build number**: Is set via the `CFBundleVersion` property. It's not visible in the App Store. It has to be incremented before uploading a new build. (`99993` on the screenshot)

A build train contains all builds for a give `version number` (e.g. `0.9.21`). Within the build train you have *n* builds, each having a different `build number` (e.g. `99993`).

```ruby
# Access the build train via the version number
train = app.build_trains["0.9.21"]

train.version_string          # => "0.9.21"
train.external_testing_enabled         # => false, as external testing is enabled for 0.9.20

# Access all builds for a given train
train.builds.count            # => 1
build = train.builds.first

# Enable beta testing for a build train
# This will put the latest build into beta testing mode
# and turning off beta testing for all other build trains
train.update_testing_status!(true, 'external')
```

## Builds

```ruby
# Continue from the BuildTrains example
build.build_version           # => "99993"  (the build number)
build.train_version           # => "0.9.21" (the version number)
build.install_count           # => 1
build.crash_count             # => 0

build.testing_status          # => "Internal" or "External" or "Expired" or "Inactive"
```

You can even submit a build for external beta review
```ruby
parameters = {
  changelog: "Awesome new features",
  description: "Why would I want to provide that?",
  feedback_email: "contact@company.com",
  marketing_url: "http://marketing.com",
  first_name: "Felix",
  last_name: "Krause",
  review_email: "contact@company.com",
  phone_number: "0123456789",
  significant_change: false,

  # Optional Metadata:
  privacy_policy_url: nil,
  review_user_name: nil,
  review_password: nil,
  encryption: false
}
build.submit_for_beta_review!(parameters)
```

## Processing builds

To also access those builds that are "stuck" at `Processing` at App Store Connect for a while:

```ruby
app.all_processing_builds       # => Array of processing builds for this application
```

## Submit app for App Store Review

```ruby
submission = app.create_submission

# Set app submission information
submission.content_rights_contains_third_party_content = false
submission.content_rights_has_rights = true
submission.add_id_info_uses_idfa = false

# Finalize app submission
submission.complete!
```

For a full list of available options, check out [app_submission.rb](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/spaceship/lib/spaceship/tunes/app_submission.rb).

## Testers

There are 3 types of testers:

- **External testers**: usually not part of your team. You can invite up to 10000 external testers. Before distributing a build to those testers you need to submit your app to beta review.
- **Internal testers**: Employees that are registered in your App Store Connect team. They get access to all builds without having to wait for review.
- **Sandbox testers**: Dummy accounts to test development-mode apps with in-app purchase or Apple Pay.

```ruby
# Find a tester based on the email address
tester = Spaceship::TestFlight::Tester.find(app_id: "some_app_id", email: "felix@krausefx.com")

# Creating new testers
Spaceship::TestFlight::Tester.create_app_level_tester(
      app_id: "io.myapp",
       email: "github@krausefx.com",
  first_name: "Felix",
   last_name: "Krause"
)

```
Right now, _spaceship_ can't modify or create internal testers.

```ruby
# Load all sandbox testers
testers = Spaceship::Tunes::SandboxTester.all

# Create a sandbox tester
testers = Spaceship::Tunes::SandboxTester.create!(
  email: 'sandbox@test.com', # required
  password: 'Passwordtest1', # required. Must contain >=8 characters, >=1 uppercase, >=1 lowercase, >=1 numeric.
  country: 'US', # optional, defaults to 'US'
  first_name: 'Steve', # optional, defaults to 'Test'
  last_name: 'Brule', # optional, defaults to 'Test'
)

# Delete sandbox testers by email
Spaceship::Tunes::SandboxTester.delete!(['sandbox@test.com', 'sandbox2@test.com'])

# Delete all sandbox testers
Spaceship::Tunes::SandboxTester.delete_all!
```

## App ratings & reviews

```ruby
# Get the rating summary for an application
ratings = app.ratings # => Spaceship::Tunes::AppRatings

# Get the number of 5 star ratings
five_star_count = ratings.five_star_rating_count

# Find the average rating across all stores
average_rating = ratings.average_rating

# Find the average rating for a given store front
average_rating = app.ratings(storefront: "US").average_rating

# Get reviews for a given store front
reviews = ratings.reviews("US") # => Array of hashes representing review data

```

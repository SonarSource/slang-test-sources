You might also want to check the last ~1k lines of
`/opt/metasploit/apps/pro/engine/config/logs/framework.log` or
`~/.msf4/logs/framework.log` for relevant stack traces


## System stuff

### Metasploit version

Get this with the `version` command in msfconsole (or `git log -1 --pretty=oneline` for a source install).

- [ ] Kali package via apt
- [ ] Omnibus installer (nightly)
- [ ] Commercial/Community installer (from http://www.rapid7.com/products/metasploit/download.jsp)
- [ ] Source install (please specify ruby version)

It would be easy to say that people are intimidated by the large group, but in some meetings I think there\'s another problem: it\'s often the case that people just say \'come and grab me after the meeting\'. I\'m sure that works well, but I like it when a summary of the solution arrives back via email or at the next meeting, so that the whole office can benefit from the knowledge transfer.</p>",

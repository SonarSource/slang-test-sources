**Set up Discourse in the cloud in under 30 minutes** with zero knowledge of Rails or Linux shell. We recommend [DigitalOcean][do], but these steps will work on any **Docker-compatible** cloud provider or local server.

>  🔔 Don't have 30 minutes to set this up? For a flat one-time fee of $99, the community can install Discourse in the cloud for you. [Click here to purchase a self-supported community install](https://www.literatecomputing.com/product/discourse-install/).

### Create New Cloud Server

[Sign up for DigitalOcean][do], update billing info, then create your new cloud server.

- The default of **Ubuntu 16.04 LTS x64** works fine. At minimum, a 64-bit Linux OS with a kernel version of 3.10+ is required.

- The default of **1 GB** RAM works fine for small Discourse communities. We recommend 2 GB RAM for larger communities.

- The default of **New York** is a good choice for most US and European audiences. Or select a region that is geographically closer to your audience.

- Enter your domain `discourse.example.com` as the name.

Create your new Droplet. You will receive an email with the root password. (However, if you know [how to use SSH keys](https://www.google.com/search?q=digitalocean+ssh+keys), you may not need a password to log in.)

### Access Your Cloud Server

Connect to your server via its IP address using SSH, or [Putty][put] on Windows:

    ssh root@192.168.1.1

Enter the root password from the email DigitalOcean sent you when the server was set up. You will be prompted to change the root password.

### Install Docker / Git

    wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh

This command installs the latest versions of Docker and Git on your server. Alternately, you can manually [install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and the [Docker package for your OS](https://docs.docker.com/installation/).

### Install Discourse

Create a `/var/discourse` folder, clone the [Official Discourse Docker Image][dd] into it:

    sudo -s
    mkdir /var/discourse
    git clone https://github.com/discourse/discourse_docker.git /var/discourse
    cd /var/discourse

You will need to be root through the rest of the setup and bootstrap process.

### Email

> ⚠️ **Email is CRITICAL for account creation and notifications in Discourse.** If you do not properly configure email before bootstrapping YOU WILL HAVE A BROKEN SITE!

- Already have a mail server? Great. Use your existing mail server credentials.

- No existing mail server? Check out our [**Recommended Email Providers for Discourse**][mailconfig].

- To ensure mail deliverability, you must add valid [SPF and DKIM records](https://www.google.com/search?q=spf+dkim) in your DNS. See your mail provider instructions for specifics.

### Domain Name

> 🔔 Discourse will not work from an IP address, you must own a domain name such as `example.com` to proceed.

- Already own a domain name? Great. Select a subdomain such as `discourse.example.com` or `talk.example.com` or `forum.example.com` for your Discourse instance.

- No domain name? We can [recommend NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/domain-name-search.aspx?utm_source=SAS&utm_medium=Affiliate&utm_campaign=1632369&affnetwork=sas), or there are many other [great domain name registrars](https://www.google.com/search?q=best+domain+name+registrars) to choose from.

- Your DNS controls should be accessible from the place where you purchased your domain name. Create a DNS A record for the `discourse.example.com` subdomain in your DNS control panel, pointing to the IP address of your cloud instance where you are installing Discourse.

### Edit Discourse Configuration

Launch the setup tool at

    ./discourse-setup

Answer the following questions when prompted:

    Hostname for your Discourse? [discourse.example.com]: 
    Email address for admin account(s)? [me@example.com,you@example.com]: 
    SMTP server address? [smtp.example.com]: 
    SMTP port? [587]: 
    SMTP user name? [user@example.com]: 
    SMTP password? [pa$$word]: 
    Let's Encrypt account email? (ENTER to skip) [me@example.com]: 

This will generate an `app.yml` configuration file on your behalf, and then kicks off bootstrap. Bootstrapping takes between **2-8 minutes** to set up your Discourse. If you need to change these settings after bootstrapping, you can run `./discourse-setup` again (it will read your old values from the file) or edit `/containers/app.yml` with `nano` and then `./launcher rebuild app`, otherwise your changes will not take effect.

**NOTE:** You should not attempt to enable Let's Encrypt unless the DNS record for hostname resolves to your server. You can run `./discourse-setup` again later to make any changes.

### Start Discourse

 Once bootstrapping is complete, your Discourse should be accessible in your web browser via the domain name `discourse.example.com` you entered earlier, provided you configured DNS. If not, you can visit the server IP directly, e.g. `http://192.168.1.1`.

### Register New Account and Become Admin

Register a new admin account using one of the email addresses you entered before bootstrapping.

<img src="https://www.discourse.org/images/install/17/discourse-activate.png" width="650">

(If you are unable to register your admin account, check the logs at `/var/discourse/shared/standalone/log/rails/production.log` and see our [Email Troubleshooting checklist](https://meta.discourse.org/t/troubleshooting-email-on-a-new-discourse-install/16326).)

After registering your admin account, the setup wizard will launch and guide you through basic configuration of your Discourse.

<img src="https://www.discourse.org/images/install/17/discourse-wizard-step-1.png" width="650">

After completing the setup wizard, you should see Staff topics and **READ ME FIRST: Admin Quick Start Guide**. This guide contains advice for further configuring and customizing your Discourse install.

### Post-Install Maintenance

- We strongly suggest you turn on automatic security updates for your OS. In Ubuntu use the `dpkg-reconfigure -plow unattended-upgrades` command.
- If you are using a password and not a SSH key, be sure to enforce a strong root password. In Ubuntu use the `apt-get install libpam-cracklib` package. We also recommend `apt-get install fail2ban` which will default block any IP addresses for 10 minutes that attempt more than 3 password retries.
- If you need or want a default firewall, [turn on ufw](https://meta.discourse.org/t/configure-a-firewall-for-discourse/20584).

You will get email reminders as new versions of Discourse are released. Please stay current to get the latest features and security fixes. To **upgrade Discourse to the latest version**, visit `/admin/upgrade` in your browser and click the Upgrade button.

The `launcher` command in the `/var/discourse` folder can be used for various kinds of maintenance:

```
Usage: launcher COMMAND CONFIG [--skip-prereqs] [--docker-args STRING]
Commands:
    start:      Start/initialize a container
    stop:       Stop a running container
    restart:    Restart a container
    destroy:    Stop and remove a container
    enter:      Use nsenter to get a shell into a container
    logs:       View the Docker logs for a container
    bootstrap:  Bootstrap a container for the config based on a template
    rebuild:    Rebuild a container (destroy old, bootstrap, start new)
    cleanup:    Remove all containers that have stopped for > 24 hours

Options:
    --skip-prereqs             Don't check launcher prerequisites
    --docker-args              Extra arguments to pass when running docker
```

          Sometimes you may wish to **hide details** in your replies:

          - When you’re discussing plot points of a movie or TV show that would be considered a spoiler.

          - When your post needs lots of optional details that may be overwhelming when read all at once.

          [details=Select this to see how it works!]
          1. Select the <img src="%{base_uri}/plugins/discourse-narrative-bot/images/font-awesome-gear.png" width="16" height="16"> gear in the editor.
          2. Select "Hide Details".
          3. Edit the details summary and add your content.
          [/details]

          Can you use the <img src="%{base_uri}/plugins/discourse-narrative-bot/images/font-awesome-gear.png" width="16" height="16"> gear in the editor to add a details section to your next reply?
